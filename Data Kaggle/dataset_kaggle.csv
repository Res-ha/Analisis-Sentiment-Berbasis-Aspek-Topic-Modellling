H G,"Unable to use it as it won't work with my Google calendar. Tech support is horrible - ""Tali"" keeps asking for a screenshot of the native calendar she thinks came with the phone. It's a Motorola Edge that is all stock Android, thus Google calendar. They don't get it, and refuse to escalate my request for help to a higher level. EDIT: Now your team has a copy of the chat from Motorola explaining that there is no ""native"" calendar app other than Google. Since you know my case in this review area, your tech dept must be tiny. I really wanted to like this app, but it's very buggy with the Google calendar app it's advertised to work so well with.",1,2021-01-11 01:12:58
Michelle Armstrong,"I downloaded this because of the cross platform syncing. I only purchase apps after learning the free version. I see the potential but will delete because: 1) constant advertising the premium version - which is keeping me from being productive - which is counter productive 2) It seems on desktop version that I don't have a choice on calendar to see day, 3 days, week, month 3) and again the pop up for premium Anyway.

Yiğitcan Sümbelli,"I am starting to hate this app! Every time they update, I start to have the exact same problem; I cannot edit/delete any of my events through any.do app. When I contact them about the issue, they just suggested me to check&uncheck my calendars and it was not helpful at all (even though I believe they really tried to help)! The problem went away magically at the first time but after an update, it came back now. Ugh, so annoying!",1,2020-12-02 15:52:24
Jon Pember,"Liked Any.do at first, enough that I even signed up for premium so I could schedule reoccurring tasks. However, I soon learned that it doesn't interface with Google Calendars the way that it claims. Instead, you have to sign up for a 3rd party service called Zapier. The link never worked right. Anything I scheduled in Any.do would stay there and not sync. Initially my purchase receipt said ""cancel anytime,"" but now they won't refund the 10 months of service I haven't used.

Chris Keyes,"I paid premium for years. No more! This app has become unreliable. It randomly reorders my daily tasks & listings/very frustrating.

At least your frustration will not cost you your hard earned money! In reply to Any.do (below) With all due respect your app DOES exactly what I described. I did ask help.

rainrunner13,"Wunderlist was everything I needed and I had no issues with the app. This ""replacement"" tried to keep a somewhat similar format, but replaced the things that I really enjoyed from the original app. I don't like having a list app connected to Google or the rest of my accounts. I just wanted something simple that I could easily share with my family. I'm really disappointed with this forced move to a new app. Can't Wunderlist be allowed to continue to function?!",1,2020-04-30 06:46:02

If you're planning on using it for something like a hardware store and need Building Supplies, Electrical, Plumbing etc you're out of luck. You can't even add Quantity!

They're not listed as complete, they just disappear. Sometimes they'll come back but sometimes I have to re-enter them...assuming I remember. I pay for this app, so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable. It may have something to do with syncing... no idea.

There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh.

I understand some may want the upside of being able to back up their calender if something happens to their phones. I don't. My previous phone had a built in calender widget that did not require me to sync with Google in any way.",2,2018-12-27 18:54:03

Lucas,"I am a paid user of this app. I like this app a lot, until Android 10. They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day. So it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between. Not cool. 👎",2,2019-12-17 19:34:49

One step for the hour another for the minutes and ANOTHER for am/pm.& if u mess up thats it u have to start over. Too many steps,2,2019-01-09 21:45:58
Spencer Frail,Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time.

If you're planning on using it for something like a hardware store and need Building Supplies, Electrical, Plumbing etc you're out of luck. You can't even add Quantity!

I'm posting this here in the hopes that maybe others are experiencing the same issue, and that will prompt more serious investigation by the any.do staff. The issue I am seeing occurs when setting a reminder for a future date. Go thru the usual process, app records the reminder date/time correctly, then sometimes minutes, or even seconds later, the reminder shows up as a current task under ""today"". Its happening intermittently, but at least 50% of the time. I've used any.do for several years, so I know its not a situation of not knowing how to use the app. Clearing data and cache and reinstalling has not helped. Any.do support is trying to help, wants a video, but I can't take a video of every time I set a reminder hoping to catch the issue. Its unrealistic. If anyone else using the app is experiencing this issue, please please please let Any.do support know. I won't discount its an issue specific to my device, but the fact that the app ran fine for years, until an update, has me thinking otherwise.",3,2020-11-23 13:28:15

When you create a task, that reoccurs daily and you didn't do the task today, the next instance of the task is added on the next day to your today list.

My personal list replicated itself 13 times and when I deleted the second to last iteration of this it deleted everything I had ever typed into my lists.  Calendar support only available on ipad and android phone, not in browser window.  You have to trick the system into puting a date on items by setting a reminder and then going back in to deactivate the reminder.  I like that you can move items around however you want and that items left undone today stay in the today category instead of just floating out of the system.

Kimberly Bronson,"I have used this for a while and, though it isn't a perfect fit, it does a great job of allowing me to schedule alarms for tasks and easy snoozing of those alarms. But they updated and fixed what wasn't broken. Now, all uncompleted tasks show in the task window with no delineation of whether they are recent, scheduled, or past due. Visually, it is very confusing. I'm probably going to dump this app. I would like a good calendar view of things scheduled on each day and it doesn't have that.",3,2020-06-29 10:55:24
Ann Shea,"Honestly, this app is not user friendly, is not intuitive. When I try to schedule a repeating task, it's confusing. After selecting a task to be repeated, I am asked how many days?! What the heck does that mean?! How the heck can I SIMPLY set a task to be repeated every day? Developers, where's the user guide?",3,2018-12-05 11:39:57
Latrice Jamison,"The app is pretty good and has good features. However, when I shared a grocery list with my fiance it wouldn't let him accept and it it sent him TONS of emails regarding it. Literally 1 every few minutes for hours and I have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing. Given that sharing is a big part of why I wanted the app, it does put a damper on things for me.",3,2020-01-05 22:14:34
Geoff Gilman,"It's got promise, just not there yet. To many glitches to justify the premium version. Small things here an there but the main problem is events consistently erase information and become in unable to edit. Now you have permanent events stuck in your calendar that cannot be changed. For the free version I guess you could put up with it but it's still annoying. It's got style and potential. One day I hope to be back and check it out again.",3,2020-06-18 21:24:13
Caleb Wells,New update was step backwards. My recommemdations: 1) Have daily/weekly/monthly calendar views that show reminders and events in visual boxes (instead of just a list). 2) allow rearranging of the order of subtasks and add subtask reminder capability. Also should be able to check off individual subtasks. 3) allow a task to be turned into a calendar event instead of just a reminder 4) show that an event has subtasks from main view,3,2019-01-02 15:30:39
Taya,"Just one thing and I will definitely change to 5 stars. Make the 'Quick add bar' easier to use! Just expand the letter 'ADD A TASK' in the notification bar. Or at least make it easier to reach when using one hand. I'm right handed but the 'add a task' is located on the bottom left of the bar so it's hard to reach with a thumb.

CHERI CHILDERS,"It could be great but too hard to delete an item on your agenda. It's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that I paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day, but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and I tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely",3,2018-12-03 09:36:39
Stephen Bryant,"Overall, I like the app. However, I'm uninstalling because of the pop-up notification that goes over other apps and basically freezes my phone until i dismiss it. The app doesn't have permission to draw over other apps and no way to disable this notification.

Jesus Mondragon,"I've been using the app for a while mostly just as a reminder app. Finally, I put together a plan to use it as my primary task tracker. Great app for managing tasks 👏 A little learning curve 🤔 Sync with Google Calendar was easy 😁 No CUSTOM Task reminder sounds?!!? 😡 (💦 sound = Drink) Also, no multi-reminders for Tasks or times for Subtasks. Had to put 4 of the SAME daily tasks in as Stretch 1, Stretch 2....etc.",3,2018-09-12 16:29:11
Kathleen Cervas,"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority. I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update",3,2019-12-13 13:26:24

Ewan Cox,The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.,3,2020-01-26 04:23:04

Co Paloma,"I like it, a lot and also not a lot. I like the way it looks once the tasks are created, but I dislike creating the tasks using the current interface. 4 comments. 1. I have the full version with WhatsApp linked and it causes duplicate reminders. 2. The widgets are not recognized by my homescreen replacement app (go launcher). 3. I would like to be able to resize the fonts and spacing. 4. Creating tasks via WhatsApp or Google assistant is very limited in its possibilities and often erroneous.",3,2020-01-17 19:52:18
Nathan Deen,"Used to think it was a 5 star app but they keep making it worse (and worse). Specifically it wrongly interprets touch screen movements putting tasks in random locations rather than where you drop them, often the very end of all your tasks, so you have to waste time dragging it back, sometimes for dozens of items. Reminders bug me the moment I wake up & won't switch off. You only let me move a reminder 15m, 1hr, 3 hrs. So with a list of 20 things I get 20 reminders 3 hrs later. Annoying as hell.",3,2019-05-07 12:14:10
Cody McLean,I've turned off every notification option I can find and I still get pop up reminders on my screen. I just want a silent reminder in my notification bar.

Denise Garcia,"Some nice features here. Their approach really set it apart from the other I've tried so far. It's a strong contender as a Wunderlist replacement. The only reason I am still not confident on a switch is their Wear integration. It's terrible! The app doesn't listen to the watch at all. I've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing. The watch app can only add tasks, so the screenshots they're sharing here are DECEPTIVE. I also wish I could hide completed task, instead of deleting.",3,2019-12-14 19:35:03
Dan Lake,"The app is OK but it could be much better in terms of usability. For example: 1. When setting a new reminder, the first button (which you are most likely to press without thinking) should be 'set timer', not 'share the task'. More people will want to set a reminder than share a person note. 2. The 'focus' button when the reminder comes up is in the prime location for when you are typing/using your phone and leads to you accidentally cancelling reminders each time.",3,2020-02-03 21:12:16

Jessica Canales,"Great app! But have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market! Trust me people are looking for this! 1) The ability to add your schedule with a few clicks. For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)",3,2019-09-20 15:14:03
Daniel Serratos,I really like must of the app but it has 2 horrible bugs that made me uninstall it.

Cheedance,I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time.

vorcazm,This app refuses to let you set a reminder for any day other than the current day without buying premium. i want to remind myself to workout every Wednesday but it's monday so I'm only allowed to schedule reminders on Monday.

I'm posting this here in the hopes that maybe others are experiencing the same issue, and that will prompt more serious investigation by the any.do staff. The issue I am seeing occurs when setting a reminder for a future date. Go thru the usual process, app records the reminder date/time correctly, then sometimes minutes, or even seconds later, the reminder shows up as a current task under ""today"". Its happening intermittently, but at least 50% of the time. I've used any.do for several years, so I know its not a situation of not knowing how to use the app. Clearing data and cache and reinstalling has not helped. Any.do support is trying to help, wants a video, but I can't take a video of every time I set a reminder hoping to catch the issue. Its unrealistic. If anyone else using the app is experiencing this issue, please please please let Any.do support know.

Walton Pantland,"Nuisance app. It probably works fine, but it's definitely not for me. However, when I decided to uninstall it, it gave me no easy way to delete my account. To delete my account I need to enter a password. I never set a password because I signed up with Google. So I have to login to create a password just to enter password to delete the account. I haven't figured out how to revoke the permissions I gave. This is abusive. Deleting an account and data should be straightforward.",3,2020-10-14 08:09:17

Ibrahim El-Fakih,"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes.

Also, it seems like there is a new feature where every time you back out of a task, it asks you if you want to save or discard; previously, it just auto-saved, which was very neat. On top of that, whenever I try to add a tag to my task, it doesn't save. It either takes me multiple tries to save the tag, or it just never saves. Plz fix.",4,2020-12-26 05:48:32

Nick Moore,Would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. The calendar widget is a complete failure. It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. The whole reason I subscribed to this app was because I needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.,4,2018-10-13 11:08:09

That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day. Samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect.",4,2018-12-05 19:09:15
watson tanganyika,Great app. I really like the integration with other apps like Gmail and Trello etc. My only problem is it sometimes doesn't show notifications.,4,2020-08-17 06:37:28
Sinerak Vale,"I really love this app. I find myself wanting to make tasks for myself about it. It has an incredibly clean UI and feels great to use. The only issue I have with it is the pricing model for the pro version. For 5 or 6- admittedly useful- features, there's a monthly subscription. Which personally I find to be ludicrous. I'd willingly pay a one time charge, but a monthly payment is just silly for this app.",4,2018-10-02 11:26:19
Jim Manley,"Useful program. Could be the center of my daily activities. Would be better-smoother, more integration with Gmail and Google Calendar with, again, better, easy, even default--'scheduled follow-ups' on same screen--Category, Priority, Time/Date. No less important, drag and drop tasks onto other Categorical Tasks to create a Categorical Hierarchy based on Time/Date/Priority-Level in the Task. Then, instantly shows in Google Calendar with a simple, mouse-over 'Zoom-to-Task' in the Calendar.",4,2019-02-03 19:40:42
Make Money With Cassie,"I love this app and I am so glad that I have found it. I wish I had found it sooner, then I wouldn't have wasted my money on other apps! The only things I would like improved is: - preview of the tasks in the tags and my list view. - the box view for the tags to be colour coded. Instead of the text, the whole box is in the chosen colour. - Quicker synchronisation with windows Keep up the great work!",4,2019-10-21 22:34:46
Sam T,Loving this app so far. My only concern is that it does not highlight the current date on the calender when I open the app if there are no tasks/events for that day. This can be confusing. Another concern is that the calender does not indicate whether there are tasks/events for particular days by showing tiny dots next to the date.,4,2018-10-22 10:34:46
Harvey Andruss,"Real nice app. I like links to google calendar for events, reminders. Not sure about tasks. Have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events? It'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks. Right now I use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar. I'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up (shows time blocks as busy in Calendar). Thanks",4,2018-12-19 14:39:37
Michael Gordon,"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues",4,2020-07-17 06:58:29
Dreaston Bikrain,Tl;dr the calendar in the widget needs to put days which have an event in a colored or multicolored circle for better noticeability So far this is the best personal task management software on the market. In this month I have finally came to the realization that I need one so I tried out 6 of them. There was only 2 of them that seemed worth further investigation. Only any.do had a good enough widget and a clear interface. I showed the application to my father but after a day he said that its great but he cant really see what days in the calendar of the widget contain events. Even I have sometimes problem with it. If the days which contain events would be in a colored circle then it would be much easier to notice. And since events may have a different color then the colored circle itself could contain multiple colors.,4,2018-09-20 13:18:37
JustA Guy,"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.",4,2020-05-15 05:32:47
Lisa Z,"I like the ease of creating different to do lists, ability to create subtasks, and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store I shop at. It's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you. However, i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item, that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category. I also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it. Nice work 👍",4,2019-03-14 22:17:55

Katarine Leal,"So far, so good! I've been eyeing this app for quite a long time and I'm pretty satisfied so far!

And I'd love to see more features with the tags, like being able to sort tasks by them and putting different ""levels"" on them. For instance, this tag has more priority than the others.

Laura Stanhope,"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.",4,2020-06-23 14:01:06

Also, it seems like there is a new feature where every time you back out of a task, it asks you if you want to save or discard; previously, it just auto-saved, which was very neat. On top of that, whenever I try to add a tag to my task, it doesn't save. It either takes me multiple tries to save the tag, or it just never saves. Plz fix.",4,2020-12-26 05:48:32

Janice Deynira,"I love Any. but got a few things I don't like. For some reason events cannot be colored when they are written directly to Any.do as it happens on Google Calendar and Zapier doesn't give you that option. I have to write the event in Google Calendar, put the color I want to see it in Any.do. It would be great if you could enable that option. Other idea please put a Report option of things done in the day and task completed. Thanks",4,2020-09-26 16:57:50

Alexander Molnar,"The app itself is fantastic, and the customer service is out of this world! Extremely fast, polite, and went to great lengths to fix my problem. And let's not forget the widget, it's absolutely phenomenal. Haven't seen anything like it since ACalendar+ (which I loved, but it doesn't provide the list sharing and a bunch of other things that Any.Do does). Highly recommended!",5,2021-01-05 20:37:34

Josie Setiawan,"I love this app, it looks stunning and clean which personally is important to me, and everything works smoothly as intended- setting reminders for tasks, repetition, notes, etc. One thing I'd like is for ""subtasks"" to be able to appear on the main task page under the main task, maybe a button to toggle this. If there already is, I'm not sure how to access it. Other than that, I'm excited to use the app to be more organized.",5,2020-12-10 06:39:20

Ryan Wingfield,I usually don't use planner apps as they can be quite confusing and fill my phone up with notifications. But this app has actually helped me be more productive. I can plan what I need doing and when I want it done by along with a really helpful pop up to remind me at the time. If I can't do it at that time it gives me the option to snooze the pop up for anytime. I would 100% recommend this app if you want to be more organised and productive.,5,2020-12-14 19:21:17

Eric Bressler,"Really, really nice app. It is missing some features I'd like to see. For instance, it's sort of hard to schedule your day, so it works better as a to-do list. You can do it, but it's an arduous process. However, the interface is great. You can schedule reminders, and it's worked better for me than other free apps like Trello or ToDoist.",5,2020-11-09 05:31:19

F Sh,I purchased a premium but in the app it doesn't allow me to create more than 5 projects and it says upgrade to premium. This is rediculous. The funny part is when I click on upgrade to premium again it says you have it already. I want a full refund.,1,2021-01-08 22:41:04
Tramona SG,Immediate uninstall and 1 star rating because you have to PAY FOR PREMIUM in order to access the REMINDER function - utter foolishness! The whole purpose of me looking for a To Do List app is so that I can be reminded of my daily tasks.,1,2021-01-05 03:48:45

Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks.

I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom.

Andy Byrd,Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.,2,2019-05-22 13:41:48

Tracey Powers,"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",2,2020-04-15 15:44:14

Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,3,2019-04-09 17:52:21
CJ Chatham,"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget.

Victor Gauzzi,"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list",3,2019-04-01 17:58:04
pooya tolideh,"I've used Todoist for years and it's a fantastic app BUT I won't give it more stars unless they show sub-projects under the parent project again, like it is on desktop. **Edit**: I added one more star for having configurable swipe settings, which I really appreciate.

Andy Richardson,"PREVIOUSLY: The best to-do app by a million billion miles! I have tried many other systems and this one beats all the others for sheer usability and adjustability- excellent system. 26/10/19 UPDATE: This major update to your app is, for me, unfortunately counter intuitive, poor and makes my life harder! I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",3,2019-10-26 10:04:52
George Bezerra,"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design.

Tereza Fuxová,"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me.

Michael Robbertze,"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again.

Frankly Freddie,"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform.

It helped me greatly.",3,2020-01-18 01:17:12

I don't use Todoist for long-term planning (I use my other task manager for that) or for important tasks or projects because Todoist simply is not built for actual projects although it refers to its lists as ""projects"". What Todoist and many users actually are wanting from Todoist is a task outliner close to MyLifeOrganized, Notion, Dynalist where projects exist within the task outline.

Make it possible to like with my calendar and alert of of schedule conflicts, allow me to send task collaboration invites to others via text or email and be able to coordinate with other tourist users on joint tasks, finally a place holder for brainstormed tasks that I'll prioritize at a later date.

Gene Whitehead,"Todoist is great, no questions about it. Well built, nicely designed, regularly updated. I've been a premium user since Wunderlist was on the chopping block.

Shaun M,"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",3,2020-09-20 22:34:36

Daniel Krenn,Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help.

Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists.

Polly Peterson,"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there.",3,2020-04-07 02:57:13

To use this app as a diary, you type your diary entry as the name of a new task, assign it to Today (so that it will be displayed with the date) in a special project e.g. ""Diary"" (can only be done before the task is completed) and click the box to complete it.",4,2020-12-30 23:42:15
Mark Cay,"I love this app so much. It offers a lot of features yet the file size of this app is minimal. The only problem I have with this app is when I try to edit my account name, it only concatenates my input from my previous name, and I just see white background in input and also without blinking text cursor. Please fix this and I'll rate it 5 stars for sure.",4,2020-12-24 01:10:03
CellABQ TWC,"So far, so good! I am just learning and have adhd; it seems user-friendly enough to benefit from immediately, while offering more complex options when I'm ready. I'm looking forward to getting better at using it.",4,2021-01-07 00:03:05
Kharizma Guerrero,"It's very helpful although, I would like the task to stay for the whole day instead or just cross it out so I could see what tasks I have accomplished. Overall, it exceeded my expectations. Good job!",4,2021-01-07 09:19:29
Queeniee Fuentes,"I love this app, this fit my needs. I would give 5 star if you also put a calendar widget, then this app would be perfect. I highly recommend it.",4,2021-01-02 13:44:41

Gabor Kalmar,"Great app, the only thing missing is a timeline function, it would be really helpful visually. It could be easily added by simply adding a start date option to a task, so each task stretches through a time period. It would be a separate section below the calendar, or an alternative view of the calendar.",4,2020-12-20 14:27:04

Jennifer McGaffey,"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget.",4,2020-12-08 17:30:24
Holly Cumming,"Would like a list to be available, showing dates that repeating tasks were completed on. So I can see in one place all the dates I exercised on for example. That's the only thing I can think of to improve it! Also being able to set the list a new task automatically gets added to would be nice. I never use the inbox list because I know you can't see a list of completed items there. I put everything in a ""to do"" project list so completed tasks don't disappear with no record they ever existed!",4,2020-12-03 23:29:13
Nik T,"I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I'd probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They're given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.",4,2020-11-28 04:24:44
Renee M,"Works amazing both on the website for my desktop and on my phone. But the new update, board view, on the app doesn't work properly. Some of the sections of my projects in board view are not being displayed but they reappear when I add a task in that section.",4,2020-11-26 03:36:44
Tejender Singh,"I have tried many to do list apps out there, but this one seems to fit my needs, most of it anyways. The only gripe I have with this app is that it's not integrated properly with good assistant. So if I am busy or driving and want to add a task, I end up using Google reminder. But it could be Google's problem as well. All in all its good.",4,2020-11-14 14:53:16
William Brunhayne,"Really enjoying this app. One optional feature I would love to see would be disabling the ability to mark a task complete without first opening it. That way there's no chance of accidentally marking a task complete. It has only ever happened once, but now I feel the need to periodically check my completed tasks to make sure none of them were marked by accident.",4,2020-10-29 15:40:43

Ohm51,"I'm new to this application and so just using it for basic reminders and to do lists at the moment ... it seems simple at first, but it's full functionality (not exactly intuitive) is yet to be understood and utilized; and like most things there is a learning curve involved that must be taken into account.",4,2020-11-16 15:11:45
Anthony Shumov,"Sync across devices is pretty much seamless. The interface is awesome. UX in general is very smooth and pleasant. The functionality is sufficient for me in terms of customizabiluty. On the other hand, I don't like some things. 1. Themes available for premium accounts are not outstanding. 2. You can't connect Google calendars from > 1 account. 3. Some of the functionality is only available in the web app. Also, integration with Jira would've been awesome (yes, it's a hint).",4,2020-11-15 12:01:37

Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",4,2020-12-31 18:03:19

It's also increasingly hard to justify the premium, when free equivalents are getting so much better (Google's, apple, microsoft's), and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists (notion). A big gripe for me is that its design & UI is falling a little behind its competitors (things 3, apple reminders); which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app.",4,2020-09-13 00:22:00

Tom Wilkes,"I needed a To do app, after trying 5 or 6 this is by far the best. I have it installed on 5 phones within my family now as well as pc's and Mac's to make sure tasks that were forever being forgotten are no longer left behind. The only drawback I have found so far is that you cannot set a reoccurring event. There are many tasks that I do for work or home that happen weekly, monthly or annually. I can go through and add events in the future but this would be a huge task. Am I missing something?",4,2021-01-06 08:47:29

Haven McClure,"Reliable, flexible, easy to use. I have more flexibility in organizing my to-do list the way I want to see it, and still use GTD. Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",4,2020-12-31 18:03:19

Gerard Vila,"It took me 2 days to notice the ""show completed tasks"" command. Until then I couldn't see how to use this app as a Journal (I.e. looking into the past), not just a planning tool, and had started looking for another app that would do both. To use this app as a diary, you type your diary entry as the name of a new task, assign it to Today (so that it will be displayed with the date) in a special project e.g. ""Diary"" (can only be done before the task is completed) and click the box to complete it.",4,2020-12-30 23:42:15

That's the only thing I can think of to improve it! Also being able to set the list a new task automatically gets added to would be nice. I never use the inbox list because I know you can't see a list of completed items there.

Nik T,"I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I'd probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They're given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.",4,2020-11-28 04:24:44

Anthony Shumov,"Sync across devices is pretty much seamless. The interface is awesome. UX in general is very smooth and pleasant. The functionality is sufficient for me in terms of customizabiluty. On the other hand, I don't like some things. 1. Themes available for premium accounts are not outstanding. 2. You can't connect Google calendars from > 1 account. 3. Some of the functionality is only available in the web app. Also, integration with Jira would've been awesome (yes, it's a hint).",4,2020-11-15 12:01:37

Jen,"Excellent time management app, easy to use and helps me to organise work and home projects. I like the fact that you can create subtasks that you can schedule and that you can also use boards as well as lists. The only thing I'm not keen on is the way tasks disappear when you complete them, I would prefer it if they were crossed out instead so you don't have to look at your activity log to find this information.",5,2021-01-10 23:11:31
Justin Cost,"I really like this app and the smart tags feature of being able to tag it on a project which is super quick. You can also use boards like in Trello.

Vicky Serafino,Pushes me to do more ! I'm the kind of person who procrastinates because I feel very easily overwhelmed and it paralyses me.

Douglas Gasperak,"I live by lists. I've used so many apps, and nothing has the functionality of Todoist - especially for free. Slight learning curve if you want to use it to full capability, but the web site teaches you. Stop looking, you won't find better.",5,2020-11-23 01:06:26
Chris,"12/1/20 edit: All of my previous grievances have been corrected and improved upon including being able to add new tasks with due dates in the widget and having them auto-sort. Props on the improvements, keep up the good work :) March review: New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.",5,2020-12-01 19:58:36
João Ferreira,Very useful. Excellent interface: uncluttered but powerful.,5,2020-12-30 17:39:45

Kopymatic,"Very good at helping me stay organized. I would like the ability to make expiration dates for tasks so if i don't do them by a certain point they disappear, but that's really the only ""missing"" feature that i'd want and use.",5,2020-12-17 20:50:20
Chrysta Bailey,"This is a fantastic app, and I'm thrilled to have found it. It has all the features I need. I save time every day because manipulating and updating my to do list(s) is SO fast and easy now across all my devices (PCs, Mac, and Android). Highly recommended. Many thanks to the Todoist team!",5,2020-11-12 07:31:26
Joshua Madden,Love this app. I was addicted to another to do app and it was very difficult to make the switch. The final push was Todoist's excellent 2 way sync with Google calendar. This has made me significanly more productive from day one with this app. Love it!!,5,2020-12-01 01:37:29
Jason Ramos,"I had been using tasks in Microsoft Outlook, as well as in my case management software. But found them not very effective in helping me achieve task completion. Then I was recommended Todoist. Todoist has been a game changer. It has a unique approach to task creation, follow-up and completion, that is effective and motivates one to actually get the task done. I also love the fact that it focuses on one thing and 1 thing only: tasking. And by doing so it is extremely effective at it.",5,2020-11-07 20:11:12
Rebecca Brooks,"Todoist is the best to-do list app I have encountered & I have tried A LOT of them. Reminders? Subtasks? Tags? File attachments? Voice recording? Subprojects? Integrations? They even have templates and a blog that gives productivity tips. 2 months ago I would have suggested they have kanban boards. I was integrating MeisterTask and Todoist through Zapier because of this. But just like that, they introduced the board feature and I immediately deleted MeisterTask, just like that.",5,2020-11-06 00:56:46
Al Rokurs,Super helpful. It's easy to add tasks to any category or sub category and assign them to an individual all in one step. Helps me and my husband keep track of what needs done and how busy the other person is.,5,2020-11-28 17:10:19

Ryan,This app has come a long way in a few years. I have used a lot of task managing apps. Todoist is clean simple and it has actually replaced my whole calendar app I was using. The free version is more than good enough for everyday life managing. Highly recommend giving it a try.,5,2020-12-05 16:18:34

Raffaello Paul Garcia,"Its a great app and encourages productivity. A nitpick i have with the newest update is that the ""sorted by due date"" still appears in the widget screen, and is kind of annoying. It would be nice if that is removed, thanks!",5,2020-11-24 08:29:15
Shirley Seabridge,I love this app! It keeps all my projects and tasks organised and helps me to stay in control. Really easy to use and once you've set everything up it keeps you on track. Highly recommended.,5,2020-11-19 18:56:10
Kath Mayer,"Edit to my original review: this issue has been fixed very quickly by the devs! Working beautifully again and extremely happy with the speed of their work. Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days. Edit: I have emailed details of the bug to support.",5,2020-11-13 23:42:00
Julian Brummitt,Makes day to day tasks easier to remember and adding to the list is easy with auto recognition of date formats and tags. I can't say enough about how helpful it's been to help me get organized and make my day calmer.,5,2020-12-08 22:33:09
Marko Da Silva,"Might be slow in adding more features compared to other apps, but I think, it's because of their focus on the app's reliability - which is very much evident. Long time user, tried other apps, but I keep coming back to todoist with how useful and functional it is. It's worth trying and keeping.",5,2020-11-11 04:23:30
Maricarmen Soto,"So far the best to-do app I have used. Easy to add tasks and keep track of them, love the calendar features since I don't have to constantly remember to add repetitive tasks.",5,2020-11-11 13:18:31
Sharif,Thank you for making a Wear OS app!! This app lets me see my entire week on one screen compared to other apps. Really well thought out. Typing at night in the task auto sets a reminder for 10pm.,5,2020-12-17 16:46:43
ferdy,I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom. SOLVED,5,2020-11-23 10:46:47
Kait W,"Been using this app for a couple of years and overall it's been solid. It's not only a life-saver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the ENTIRE app. High quality developments. Seems only natural to have bugs here and there, or else they'd never be able to improve the app's functionality and innovate as a result. Attentive helpful customer support team, devs, AND they provide guides,templates and very helpful tips on their site. Keep it going :)",5,2020-10-24 20:55:05
Montanna,"This is the best to-do app I've tried. I love being able to organize my tasks into color-coded folders. It works great both on mobile and desktop. The reminder function is well worth paying for, and the cost is very reasonable.",5,2020-11-10 17:04:23

ハニン。,Best and worst app ever! I like the app in general BUT all the good features are PREMIUM so it's telling you to go premium because the available features are the ones that you have on your default phone calendar! You can't access to thee three day calendar view isn't.. the to-do list isn't either available so what's the point of having the app if you can't access to anything literally BAD APP,1,2021-01-11 12:13:16
Cyndi Lin,"Very disappointed with this app. I subscribed the app on the web, not through Android. The web app didn't have any unsubscription function to cancel the premium account. I didn't renew my account, even didn't see any renewal order, but the company auto-charged the renewal fee on my PayPal. The app didn't allow user to cancel the subscription!!!!",1,2021-01-05 15:23:30
Sven J.,"Generally happy with the app, but it's so annoying that notifications wake up the lock screen. While running with my phone in the pocket, TickTick woke up my screen, I accidentally unlocked the screen through the contact between my leg and screen (smart unlock feature helped) and then started sending messages to a friend. That shouldn't happen. Please fix this issue or at least give us the option to deactivate lock screen notifications. Using a OnePlus 7T Pro. Thanks! PS Already sent a ticket",1,2021-01-06 12:11:44

You then have to click through two more screens to tap it again just to add a reminder and set the time. To make all that official there's a tiny check at the top of the screen to tap. Then, nothing really. No confirmation or summary, nothing. You have to double check that you got it right.",1,2020-11-09 01:00:57

Geoff Jones,"This app sucks. The devs previous app GTasks was much simpler and only a once-off payment was required for the premium key. This TickTick app is just a money making venture with subscriptions. Boo! REPLY TO DEV: Thanks. There's nothing difficult to use about the app, just dropping paid Premium support for your other app GTasks and all but forcing users to now pay a subscription to change to a different app that with functions they don't need. If you look at other GTasks reviews, I'm sure you'll find similar comments.

I downloaded it because I was under the assumption that it's basic functioning was free. The subscription price is cheap but I'm careful which places I put my bank/card info as I don't feel comfortable putting any info about myself out there.,1,2020-08-19 14:43:08

I get emails with pdf documents attached, and I used to open the pdf and share it with Tick Tick, and the app would be so awesome it would create a new todo with the pdf attached to it. Now not only does the app look different, which is fine, but I can no longer share the pdf files from my email to the app. That was the whole point of using it for me. I'm really unhappy.

Eliah J. S.,"Honestly the premium version is just not worth it, what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if, in every case, you can't see future recurring events? (The next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance) In order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next, this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 (as I'm seeing online) and nothing has been done, that not only shows poor hindsight (what's a calendar without planning) but also a strikingly deaf customer service. The app is probably just as good as its free version, the pomodoro timer is ok, but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version.",2,2018-11-03 23:34:59
Jessie Newman,"I'm sure the premium might be fine, but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall. I wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone, but this surely isnt it.

Very misleading, I immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me.",2,2020-07-11 14:02:44
Zac Montuori,"Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.",2,2019-10-23 19:02:26
Patryk K,"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",2,2019-10-21 01:44:02
Marc Tokar,"This WAS a great list app. Then something happened and I stopped getting notifications. I checked the app and it said I needed to allow permissions due to Android 6.0.

Emma Marion,"This is by far the best to do list app I've come by. It has rich features and a great interface, even in the free version. It knows the difference between a task, and a habit. My main issue here with the app, is premium pricing. Why exactly do I have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline? Normally, a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for. From what I can see, there's only one. If a one time payment option is added, I'll buy it.",3,2019-08-27 11:59:55
Kalyan Natarajan,"Ticktick throws a lot of functions and features into the app, almost the whole kitchen sink. It has some very good and strong features, specially related to reminders, recurring reminders, some ability to recognise natural language dates etc. However it needs to improve MUCH more in search abilites. Except for tags and list names search terms do not show up as you type. Search for tasks with multiple word combinations in the task title does not work. Robust solid search is still sorely lacking",3,2019-09-27 12:57:08
Brayden Houston,"This app is awesome! Clean UI and great dark mode! EDIT: 6 months in and still happy mostly. It would be nice to the the development team take a little more notice of the community. No IFTTT, Google Assistant, or WearOs support. Wouldnt be so bad if there was an API but that doesnt exist either. The developers have ignored these requests month after month for years. Very frustrating!",3,2019-04-16 05:20:55

Rafiq Ibayev,"The app is awesome with its tons of functions. BUT I think it still needs some visual improvements. For example, I like to use the timer feature inside the app. But it would be good if the timer uses a gradient background based on the theme for better visualization. And each theme's dark, white and true black options such as dark green, white green, amoled green (buttons and highlight colors change). And more themes, especially gradient based themes can be awesome :)",4,2020-12-05 22:41:46

I contacted their customer support, they responded: Sorry there is no setting for that. But I will note it down as a feature request to our product team for future consideration. It's not a setting...it's a bug",4,2020-09-17 04:00:50
Mason Royal,"So far I've really liked Tick Tick. Simple and easy to create, schedule, and organize tasks. I really like how habits are integrated too. Please add some more features to habits. Let me put them in calendar view. I work mostly in the calendar view so it would be so amazing to have the habits there instead of having to create them as a task as well. It seems redundant. Please let me put habits in lists or tag them.",4,2020-08-19 17:16:19
Greg Spielman,"What happened??? This app was working great until this latest update. Now it's losing tasks left and right. Lost 4 today!! Please back out this latest update until it is properly debugged. Update: Other reviews gave me a clue to what has been happening. It's creating subtasks! I now have 5 subtasks I never wanted, and linked to totally unrelated tasks. Further Update: Sliding is what is creating subtasks. It's too sensitive and it's impossible to NOT slide while pressing to select a task!",4,2020-10-05 23:29:02
Ms. Chanandler Bong,"Habit reminder suits me best. Streak feature good. Easy making notes. At first it took me some time to figure out the app, but now m able to. The tags thing is a bit complicated.

Louisa Moreno,It's a good app I do use it alot but there are problems with it like if you put 2 or more reminders in a habit the notification won't work. And my other problem is with the premium. If you have money you can have better features and during these times you would prefer to save up. But the app is great I do recommend it.🌻,4,2020-10-13 16:47:20
Zita Suen,"1. It would be great if you have the “auto delete completed tasks after a certain time” feature in the widget. 2. Show the task that have been accidentally ticked for a couple of seconds so that I can undo the action. I know I can do that in the app, but it's just more convenient for me if you have this feature in the widget.",4,2020-09-01 15:31:36
Raven Azarath,It's amazing ok I was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each However the problem start there when you turn off the pop-up notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it I really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it,4,2020-08-12 02:24:36
Samraggi Makhal,Would have loved to give it 5 stars but the alarm does not works properly sometimes. Changed all required settings but it still misses some alarms. Other than that its the best to do list app I have ever seen. And the pomodoro is just awesome.....,4,2020-08-20 03:03:50

Ini,"It's a really good app, it help me manage my time better and know what I'm meant to be doing per time = more productivity. Only downside I've noticed is if you set a recurring task(let's say everyday 'egg' comes up) and you don't mark it as complete, the next time 'egg' comes up and you do it, you can't mark it as complete so you have to find the place where you didn't do 'egg' and mark it as complete to mark today's own as complete as well Maybe there's something to curb this, I don't know yet",4,2020-10-27 07:43:53

Mrinmoy Saha,Good app,4,2020-12-06 17:09:49
Rafiq Ibayev,"The app is awesome with its tons of functions. BUT I think it still needs some visual improvements. For example, I like to use the timer feature inside the app. But it would be good if the timer uses a gradient background based on the theme for better visualization. And each theme's dark, white and true black options such as dark green, white green, amoled green (buttons and highlight colors change). And more themes, especially gradient based themes can be awesome :)",4,2020-12-05 22:41:46

Michael Testa,Great task manager. I had to downgrade from 5 stars since my notifications will NOT work now for Android 10. I've tried EVERYTHING and still no luck. I still use Ticktick for all tasks not requiring notifications and use working built-in clock instead.,4,2020-12-04 18:27:30

Cuerava,I really like this app and it would be perfect if there was a lifetime premium version. I'm a student and it's a bit much for me to pay yearly for the next 6 years. :( I still have another great app for organising but that one sadly lacks a desktop version,4,2020-12-01 19:54:25
Santiago Rhenals,"This application is amazing to organize your time. It has a lot of useful features, making it not only a task manager but a complete toolkit to get your things done. A must for every person trying to be more productive! I don't give a 5 stars rating (yet) because I am missing being able to customize my theme while still having dark mode enabled. Appart from that, the app is awesome!",4,2020-12-01 03:17:19

Clicker Ticker,"Very good underlying offering with some usability issues. With the Android app particularly, it's all too easy to unintentionally drag an entry to be a sub-entry.

Minakshi Bramhe,Working satisfactorily.,4,2020-11-07 05:04:16

Nandu p,"Useful.. But please make it more simple and easy to use.. There are lot of features or options to customise.. But at times it felt like too complicated especially the new note creation area.

Krista Drysdale,"I have ADHD and this app really helps me to organize and structure tasks i regularly forget. I haven't run into a situation where i would need to upgrade to the premium service. You can schedule things to happen every set amount of time (i have one to remind me to clean my pet's cage every 2 weeks). You can make different categories, so I have work, school, groceries, home. You can also schedule something for a specific time or date! Very useful when i think of something i need to do later.",5,2020-12-29 18:19:09
Paul Cravens,"I used this app/website at my last job, loved it but stopped using it when I retired, thinking I could use something simpler. Mistake! When something meets all your needs, stick with it. I almost gave 4 stars to reflect my concern over some glitches and needs improvements, but realized compared to the dozen other apps I've tried (not an exaggeration) TickTick kicks ass. And they are continuing to improve the app. Some learning curve but worth it!",5,2021-01-03 20:18:09
Janna Fry,Absolutely the best to-do list app I have ever tried! I have used TickTick for several years now and it is my external brain. The customization option for each task to be set up to recur by due date vs completion date is my favorite feature. I recently switched from ios to android and found the app to work beautifully in both.,5,2021-01-08 15:21:45
Hellsing Law,"overall best todo list app and suitable for people with adhd like me. Most feature i like is the cool widget i have put on my home screen which ease the process of creating shorter tasks and displays all tasks sections. tbh, I can't complain but it's good to enable raw audio recording and not forcing it to only english I guess it's not that hard to implement just an option in settings and all no english speakers can record in their own language without translating and force it to english",5,2021-01-08 23:37:22
pittenjd,"Super good app, the best to-do list app you could ever ask for really. I use the free version right now and it's fantastic. I will definitely go for the yearly subscription at a later time when I have a little extra cash since the features it offers are really nice. Even just using the free version is still great though. However I feel the app is so good that I really want to buy the paid version to support the developers, since they deserve it for making such a stellar and useful app.",5,2020-12-23 04:27:59
Anand K S,Simple and easy to use. User friendly UI. Looking forward to use it for more days! Update after 1+ year usage - Still using it! Never met with any issues. One of the best productivity apps on the store. Highly recommended!,5,2021-01-03 17:13:54

Lots of options are available, recurring alerts, one time alerts. All reminders can be segregated into different boxes, like official, personal. Great help to complete the work on time. Even sometime, any idea strikes in mind and I just add with a future reminder, so that I should not miss. I have taken a annual subscription.",5,2020-12-16 11:28:38

Satisfaction Guranteed,"The best app I have ever used. I was on Todoist but switched to this for a comprehensive calender view and was surprised to find I like it better in almost every way. Well worth the premium cost and has done an incredible amount in helping me handle time management, goal setting, habit tracking, and more. It is my single productivity app and it does it all. I have almost no criticisms of TickTick. Stylus support would be cool! If it could replace Onenote as well I would send them all my money",5,2020-12-19 12:32:01

It might border on too much to learn at first if you don't like that sort of thing, which I do. But the app has a great introduction to the features, and the freedom to make it suit you is well worth the initial learning period. (we're talking a day or two to figure out the main things) The widgets are great ! Some features are paid only, but free is very usefull still.",5,2020-12-10 00:48:50

Seth Quackenbush,"Had some weird hiccups and things to first figure it out, but got it going smoothly. Love the option to share todo lists, and the integration with other calendars. Stand alone web version also good, widget isn't great, but all around a very solid app. No intrusive ads, and a robust free version that is still worth using it you don't want to pay the monthly fee. Highly recommend trying it out.",5,2020-10-27 18:49:34

Young Man,"There's nothing more I could want from this app. I don't even have the pro-version and I've already seen a noticeable difference in my day to day life. Before this I had trouble, sticking to habits, planning my day, creating projects. However, using this app has made that as easy as possible. And I think it's well known by now that humans follow the path of least resistance and for creating tasks, tracking habits and completing projects. This app is the path of least resistance.",5,2020-11-24 04:56:51
Maira Martinez,"Get Premium, honestly. Its worth the money! But the FREE version is pretty awesome too! I have everything so well organized: Bills, To-do list, Work List, Fitness, Daily Chores, Activities, and Habits! (I've gotten so much better at picking up good habits.) I use 3 widgets to track my daily tasks, habits and the calendar (on which you can personalize what shows up), but there's about 10 widgets & that makes it a whole lot easier to track/input. I love this app so much!",5,2020-12-04 20:03:15
Ramsay Daly,"This app is very, very well written. In particular the browser version is very intuitive and easy to use when adding sub-tasks and just in general. It has a modest subscription fee to use the full monthly calendar, and it is very well worth it. I test drove around 5-6 other apps and ended up liking this one the best and it makes sense that this is on the Editor's Choice list. Well done TickTick.",5,2020-10-28 03:33:42
Anmol Gupta,Love the app. This app has helped me to accomplish things that I have been planning since long. It was soo good that I bought the subscription within 3 days of using it. Just love it.❤️.

Gravity 1,"I would definitely say this is one of the best apps for boosting your productivity. It helps me to plan my schedule for a day. That way we can prioritise our tasks.

All together, it's a great app in this segment",5,2020-11-14 03:54:10
Michael Sohnen,"It does everything you need to be productive. You can plan your day and also just keep a seperate todo list. Only thing i would add is color coding in addition to the prioirty thing. In fact, I think the free version is so good that the devs are making a mistake because I would never pay for the extra features!",5,2020-12-04 08:59:45
Andrew Harris,"Great tool... Supports multiple ways, including Pomodoro, Calendar View (block scheduling), Habits. Supports natural language and cross OS support. I came from Things3 and feel this is a better product although it's missing start-dates vs due-dates/deadline. However for the other reasons, I find this superior. It also includes web browser capabilities.",5,2020-12-13 16:05:55
01 Aaryaman Rao,TickTick is a great app. Even without paying for premium. The amount of absolute joy this app gives me makes me contemplate paying for premium. It has a small learning curve but after a week or so you can get the hang of it. It does its job well and i highly recommend this app. I havent faced any problems with TickTick ever.,5,2020-11-13 17:45:05
Pürgatöry Priest,"Going into year 2, TT is still the best. Don't look elsewhere for a Task/To Do/Scheduling application, just get TickTick and save time and energy, none of the others comes close to TT's feature list and execution on mobile and desktop. 👍🏽👍🏽",5,2020-12-19 06:56:08
Caleb Vanravenswaay,"At a glance Most-Loved features: 1) normal and advanced modes for Setting times of events and 2) the ability to drop a list of events in and correctly parses the newlines to separate each event. (Allows pasting of multiple events from a checklist) Other than that, the fact that this is a free app and how there is so much functionality in layers for those who need more customizing, is great! (not just a checklist app, but can choose to add times of completion for an event, or 2 times for a range)",5,2020-11-04 15:57:55

Rebecca Ao,"Great! It's super quick and easy to add new tasks to my list so I can get back to them when I've got the time. I've got categories for tasks and my shopping list are in sections so I know which stores I intend to buy things from. The habit tracking is nice and simple. The repeat function for things like how many cups of water I've drank each day is handy! The pomodoro feature could use an upgrade, it's hard to tell how many I've done or how long there is until a long break while using it.",5,2020-11-13 22:41:26
Damian Ż,I've been looking for an app like this for ages! Finnaly found! The best todo app in the world. For me much much better than todoist where you have to pay even for reminders (sic!). Here you have almost everything for free. You have to try it!,5,2020-10-24 16:20:50
Mason Grundy,"This app does a great job of help you clear your mind and stop you from having a panic attack when you are busy. When I have a lot of tasks at hand, I enter them all into TickTick so I don't feel stressed having to remember them all whilst going about my day. TickTick has lots of features which open up more organisational capabilities including habits, pomo, reminders, priority and due dates. Bonuses like cross-device sync and not being bombarded by ads on the free version makes it a great app.",5,2020-12-06 22:30:18
Tim John,"Excellent. Being self employed and working from home I like Todo lists and I have found Pomodoros useful, and this app combines them well. I use this app all day and base my day on Pomodoros accomplished. It also helps me to break up the day and ensure I work on all my most important long term tasks, not just the urgent ones in my face. I bought the pro version and made a suggestion about the reminder sounds, in a few days they had made the change to the app! Very impressed.",5,2020-11-29 09:18:57
ABDULA ASHER,"This app has changed the entire course of my life. From health to relationships and productivity. This app is a life saver. One suggestion: regarding habits it would be good if it has all the quotes relating to that habit and so those quotes (maybe along with pictures?) pop up every day on reminder and motivate you. As am example If I want to go to gym, in reminder I am shown random quote written on some inspirational picture.",5,2020-10-24 11:39:19
Jahnabi Jayasree,It's a perfect app for people who can't give much time for planning...It really does help you to be organized..It has this 'Habit' feature where you can set any habit and check the number of days you were pursuing that..It's a really very effective app and I don't see any problem with this app..,5,2020-11-16 16:18:31
Joel Burstein,"Easy to use...very helpful. I love the fact I can just add tasks as I think of things on both my phone and computer. I used to send emails to myself, but those always ended of getting lost. Somehow, TickTick just seems easier and more efficient. Highly recommend!",5,2020-11-18 10:40:54
Hassan Shamaly,"Simple , well organized, easy to use 👌, I like this App.",5,2020-12-31 11:38:24
Heru Setiawan,Well I've never really written any app review before so If I do then it's either very good or very bad. This app has a lot to appreciate. Even the free version gives you enough stuff to actually use and most importantly it's buttery smooth. It supports most platforms except Linux but it's okay because the webapp is great.,5,2020-11-18 21:04:27
Rishu S,Mind-blowing app. Better than Microsoft To-do lists for sure! Has a great desktop companion app. Todoist is the only one that comes close to this one when we're comparing the to-do's and GTD apps in the marketplace. Todoist is more intuitive and fluid while lacks a lot of features. This one does it all! The most intuitive UX in this category was from Wunderlist and that space has yet to be filled.,5,2020-11-12 11:51:47
Henry Lee,"I have tried many good & best Scheduler-ToDo.List-Reminder Apps over last 2 years to find what suits me the most;& I'm still stuck on TickTick, Best of the Best among the Good.

I added goals but they were in no way saved after reinstalling for troubleshooting. I can't check them as completed. No tutorial, no character loads like in the screenshots. It's not a network problem either, it's just a broken app",1,2020-10-29 20:35:13
FatCatDev,"Are you kidding? All the cool character customization items (which are very limited in the first place) cost real money. I thought the purpose of the app was to help people by motivating them with rewards, but there's absolutely nothing interesting you can buy for your character with the regular currency. What is the point then? Ridicilous. Put ads in it if anything, but not lock the very few items you have available behind a currency that costs real money.",1,2020-10-21 02:06:38

VincentVanHorn,"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair!

Michael Parnell,This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar.

So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day.

You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription.",1,2019-08-01 18:55:18

Arturas P.,"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...",2,2019-01-16 09:33:55
Leolani Lancaster,"This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help...",2,2019-09-09 21:04:45
Eugene Kuznetsov,"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",2,2019-11-21 23:37:05
James Christian,"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",2,2018-10-28 15:15:06
Aharon Shube,"I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable",2,2020-02-01 22:48:14
Mu Pumpelmuse,"Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating.",2,2019-03-20 00:31:26
Diana Paprotny,"This app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row. Instead of getting more experience, coins, you get less the longer you do something. You should be rewarding the habits that people are building, not telling them that once they have the Habit they're going to get less for it. Otherwise, this app would get five stars for me.",2,2018-10-15 13:22:20
Sonja Haynes-Schardt,"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it.",2,2018-10-27 13:58:56
Rich Crawford,"Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens. I have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count. Or not, it kind of does what it wants at this point. I've mostly stopped using it because of this.",2,2019-06-23 18:57:26
Cameron Lowe,"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",2,2020-02-14 14:52:53
Ari Hamilton,"It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating.",2,2019-07-28 13:12:07

Ryan M,used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.,2,2019-05-24 18:27:49
Will Green,"Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.",2,2019-10-18 12:21:34
Rowan Summers,"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely.

The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always...",2,2019-01-22 11:31:46
Ed Hasaba,"I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints.",2,2019-10-09 23:15:00
Philip Bradford,"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.",2,2019-05-07 02:04:20
Georges-Henri Daigle,"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right.

A. L.,"1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review.",2,2020-01-05 12:35:34
Klaus Acobo,"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode.

Brent Kohler布伦特科勒,fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.,2,2020-03-20 03:42:18
j-Sun C,"It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels.",2,2020-05-18 04:23:10
Snow Flake,"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?!

Alex Cooper,"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store.

Alex Koufos,"Interesting concept, but execution is awful. Achievements were not working on my phone, neither were the counters, the dailies, the notifications i recurved while in the app and it constantly asked me to refresh the session because it was out of date (refreshing never worked.)

richthis guy,"Dear Habitica, This app is currently impossible for me to use. There is no save OR delete button for editing habits. I checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem. Please, please, please fix this. I will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring. The editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character. Give users a blank sheet and let THEM apply changes.",2,2020-10-09 15:03:25

j-Sun C,"It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels.",2,2020-05-18 04:23:10

Cameron Lowe,"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well.

Alex Cooper,"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",2,2020-02-02 17:03:18
Aharon Shube,"I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value.

This Is Fallacious,"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL..

I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together.

Will I,"I've basically only started so I can't say much, the art style is very cute and it so far seems very easy to navigate, but unfortunately during character customisation I encountered a bug where I could look at all the options and randomise my character, but choosing any of the actual options was impossible, I'll update this reciew later when I have more experience with the app",3,2020-11-06 20:38:28
Xirothnir X,"It's a great concept, but at some point, it'll either be a guilt trip or exploited, or both. The app can't truly tell whether or not tasks are completed, and I think it'd be easy to just create random tasks and mark them as complete without actually doing anything. I have nothing against pixelated art, but the poor pixel quality doesn't help. Again, I love the idea, but it'll need some refinement before I can take it seriously.",3,2020-11-04 21:17:22
Lynx Hart,"I love the way things are organized and it helps motivative me; however, the game has this annoying feature where every time you try to click something, you have to refresh. Sometimes tasks I've finished will disappear; sometimes they'll stay. I would hope this bug gets fixed! Other than that, a good app",3,2020-11-02 20:16:02
David Mauas,"The idea is wonderful, truly. But problems exist:
1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.
2) Monthly subscription seems highly excessive - I don't like paying for a service that remains static. This could, and should IMO, be an offline app. Particularly with the existing obvious bugs, payment is out of the question right now.
3) Tutorial is lacking: I had to figure a few things out by myself as a first time user.",3,2020-09-15 07:20:55
Sam G,"This app is amazing, it has a very user friendly interface. I'd say its great for developing habits, making short daily task list. But the only downside is there is no calendar view. So I can't plan ahead and time things for the long run. Thats why I'm giving it 3 stars",3,2020-09-17 13:36:57
Iris Banogon,"I love the concept a lot but the actual ""gaming"" aspect of it leaves a lot to be desired. If there was something we could do or level up to or actually fight. Maybe pokemon sort of format for the game. That would really make it better and keep someone interested",3,2020-10-12 16:21:16
A. K. Z.,"Great app! A few bugs here and there. Everything I've ever checked off occasionally shows up in the to do list, so that's weird. Currently I can't check off anything from my to dos and dailies. It's a bit frustrating.",3,2020-10-05 02:10:26
Lora Coggins,"As much as I have loved using the app, I ultimately used more of my time focusing on adapting to the app and using it for an extra boost of instant gratification. It would also crash often on my tablet. It's a great idea, but it doesn't suit me that well.",3,2020-08-20 12:55:29
Ilmi Ihyani,"Hey i really like your app, it is unique and great, But why does mine doesn't have a due date set up, instead it is just a start date, could you please help me?",3,2020-11-06 04:48:29

P M,"Really unique app that motivates me to get stuff done. Unfortunately, this app needs A LOT of work. I tried writing a message in a guild chat. Once it got long enough, the words disappeared behind my keyboard so I couldn't see what I was writing. When I put the keyboard down, the send button disappeared..as a result I couldn't send my message. Theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you. Theres no notifications when your party is chatting. There is also no search for guilds. I just started this app and so for these are the problems I've noticed. Otherwise it is great and I hope it improves.",3,2018-12-14 01:48:50
Jill Fleming,"This app is great and it already helping me stay on track with some things. It's surprising how much imaginary experience points can motivate. But, I am having a bug where dailies can't be set for a given day, they just revert to all days being checked. I want this app to keep me accountable for working out on certain days, so this is a major flaw.",3,2018-09-20 12:35:00
David Sikes,"Over the years the platform has become stagnant. I was a huge proponent of Habitica, using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development; but development beyond bug fixes never happened. It's a good tool with a potent gamification component, but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting—and certainly not worth paying to support.",3,2019-09-24 10:23:11
Richard Dame,"This app has a nice interface and a great idea, but it seems to suffer the same issue I've found of all habit trackers. I can't easily keep track of multiple daily iterations of a habit. If I want to create a habit of say drinking 5 bottles of water a day, I want to be able to check off and keep track of each bottle drunk, then get rewarded when I finish all five. Most of the habits I want to develop fall in this category. Could this be implemented in the future?",3,2018-09-22 22:15:57
Jose Gonzalez,The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.,3,2019-11-10 19:28:05
Benjamin Morehead,"This app is a great idea and I love all the features. However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet. I'm not sure if the app thinks I'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating. If they fix that it's 5 stars for sure.",3,2019-01-21 03:33:20
Mihai Stan,"This is a great app and it really helped me do my tasks but it doesn't work properly. For example when I try to move a habit so that the list is in the order I want it to be, the app glitches and the habit is sent back to the top. I know those problems are almost insignificant but it gets seriously annoying sometimes. Fix those little problems and I'll give this app the five stars it deserves.",3,2019-01-19 14:30:11
Brandon Patterson,Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane. I try to move a task in my list... Only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere I didn't tell it to go. I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.,3,2019-10-15 13:16:33
Miss Dee,"Great until last update. Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates.",3,2019-01-22 15:31:48
Morgan Harney,"The app itself is pretty good. My issue came from having difficulties canceling my subscription. I described everything I was doing to try to do it, what I was seeing instead of the option to unsubscribe, etc. The solution suggested did not help, so I described the situation further. The next response came from a different person, who suggested a method I had already mentioned was not working for me. After I replied again, I never got another response. I just figured out what the issue was, but I couldn't do so before getting charged again. Disappointed in the customer service.",3,2018-10-06 03:15:51
Rebecca de Vos,"I wanted to give the app more stars as I love the concept, but it's so buggy. Especially with the dailies feature... all the dailies are linked together somehow. There are some things I do Mon-Sat for instance, but not on Sundays. But when I set a task to not repeat on Sunday, it sets all tasks that way. Very frustrating.",3,2018-09-24 14:37:32
Kate Cousino,"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!",3,2019-08-09 14:22:52
Rodolfo Fava,"There are bugs that break the immersion for me. It's not as responsive as it looks, and the design should be worked out in the app. To complete a challenge, I need to post my goal on the chat, fine.

Diana Cadwell,"I've only started using this this morning; so far I'm hoping it helps with motivating me to accomplish things. It's definitely a great idea!

Cats Catz,"Love the app. Love the rewards. But, I wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous, and I wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever. Also, certain things are hard to navigate... but overall, I absolutely love this app. Use it every day. Not so much for challenges or battles, but for habit making and to do's.",3,2020-01-30 04:11:38
Dave Smith,"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists.",3,2019-05-09 13:09:38
Matthew Austin,"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform.",3,2018-12-02 10:37:47
Mazey,"The app is pretty good, but I wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in. I tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but I still lost health for not completing it daily.

Donovan DeLaughter,"Enjoying the app so far, but the widgets are quite limiting. You cannot use check lists in the widgets, and sometimes they update rather weirdly.

Just the mobile app.",3,2019-10-16 19:01:01
Nicole Dyson,"it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things.",3,2018-12-28 23:40:36
James Cook,"Great app, I only have one complaint: The Tavern system doesn't work. I went on vacation and knew I wouldn't be able to complete my dailies or even open the app for that matter, so I entered the Tavern thinking I was safe for the couple weeks I'd be gone. I just reopened the app and it told me I had died twice, took all of my gold, two of my items, and decreased two levels. Honestly considering deleting the app now, as I had over 100 gold saved and lost a piece of rare equipment",3,2019-02-12 10:57:55
Angela,"App is cool on the surface but has some things that could be improved on. For example, some things just aren't finished or stop working. In a couple customization menus there isn't an option to take off accessories while that option is available in others. Menus suddenly stop working and you have to close and reload the app to fix it. There is no in depth tutorial and a lot of stuff is up to you to figure out which can be confusing because the User Interface isn't always clear.",3,2020-05-27 19:49:36
Christina Waldén,"I really like this app though I've only used it a week. I have some suggestions though, when I add a habit I'd like to add it for the week but not weekends.

Courtney Bragg,I love the idea of it but I am having a hard time trying to get started. As I am setting up my dailies anything that I set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if I change my days on one task it changes on something else.

Trevor Caruso,"Decent app, but would be so much better if you could set the worth of your tasks. Some tasks are simple, like 'drink more water', others like 'save $2000'.

Jenni Kmiotek,"It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all. Honestly I think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed, because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work.",3,2020-02-29 04:44:56
Станислав Капелев,"I've been using Habitica for a few years now and while I love the idea, from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken. It feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing. The most annoying bugs are: party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it, spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating (have to restart the app to see new messages)",3,2020-03-23 10:00:50

Jai Titan,This is one of the better Habit tracker app Ive tried. A couple of them I deleted after a few days just because they were So Basic yet had the Audacity to charge for a Premium Service. Habitica seems to be much more realistic and actually has a more detailed U.I for setting yourself different kinds of targets/habits.

James Rhinehardt,"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",3,2019-01-15 04:48:14
Katerina Minovska,"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me.

Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired.",3,2018-10-31 00:11:58
Bea Z,Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years.

Austin Dvorak,"Decent app. Works like intended but does have bugs for the extra ""game"" part of it. constantly have to close and reopen the app because the loading bar never really loads, or white screens. Another thing is I dont think we should be paying 3 gems to change our class.

Sebastian Berg,"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",3,2020-04-28 17:26:00

Matty Todryk,This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect. I would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game.

Bryo,"I have been using this app for a while, really trying to get to grips with it but I've come to conclude that it's not me.

If the widget was able to be shrunk (or even just make the purple box invisible) it would make the experience a lot better. Also it would be nice if the ""Dailies"" header of the widget could be removed.",3,2020-11-22 10:43:43

Xirothnir X,"It's a great concept, but at some point, it'll either be a guilt trip or exploited, or both. The app can't truly tell whether or not tasks are completed, and I think it'd be easy to just create random tasks and mark them as complete without actually doing anything. I have nothing against pixelated art, but the poor pixel quality doesn't help. Again, I love the idea, but it'll need some refinement before I can take it seriously.",3,2020-11-04 21:17:22

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",3,2020-04-28 17:26:00

Kate Cousino,"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app!

Bea Z,Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,3,2019-05-24 11:56:27

Stephiroth D,"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped.

Dave Smith,"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update.

However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet.

James Rhinehardt,"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",3,2019-01-15 04:48:14
flower child,"Pretty good app overall. I don't have many complaints since I've had it for just about a week.

The Dess,"I hate the gem system. I absolutely love the app and I've had a generally positive experience. I really think it's one of a kind and gamifying activities is the future. I've been playing for a while and I'm at a pretty high level now, but I can't help to notice that there isn't much left to do at the point that I am. Sure I can level up to infinity. Sure I can talk to people. But there is a lot of repetitiveness and I probably won't stick around for too long. It's too frustrating. The only thing left is to buy fun things with gems so that I can get gold, experience, and some cool rare items. So I decided to grind challenges. And I really did! Actual IRL GRINDING. The result - nothing at all. Why? Because Challenge rewards are luck based and/or rigged most of the time. Sure I did a lotta stuff IRL but not getting rewarded for it in-game kinda ruined it. I don't blame the devs for how Challenge rewards work at all, since rewarding depends on whoever creates the Challenges. But I do think there should be more ways to get gems without paying money. Paying IRL money becomes the only way to continue to have fun at a higher level. That's never a good thing if you want people to stick around. Here are some examples of instances where gem rewards can be implemented: when reaching a certain level, when completing difficult achievements, at a certain number of check-ins, through special in-game events (not RNG based events but events based on the actual effort that you put into tasks, for example). Rewarding the players' efforts is the best way to make them stick around. A balanced relationship between the value of the currency in-game and how difficult it is to get will never stop people from buying it with real money. In many cases it does the opposite. BUT It will also motivate people to progress and continue playing. It's a win win. A lotta people on the app preach the ""it's all about enjoying and improving yourself"" mentality. Sure, but if the aesthetic goal is to ""gamify"" your daily tasks, the app needs to behave like a game, right? And good replayable games are not repetitive and always reward hard work. This might be a bad take and I might be alone on this one but regardless I hope my feedback is useful! and yes, I have no life",4,2021-01-04 14:06:45
Bianca Liebenberg,"I really like this app, however, could use a tweak: After the day is done, I want to see what's completed.

AFK Toodles,"Accidentally pasted over my original comment which said ""I love Habitica, only wished they would be more consistent in their options and naming conventions between the desktop and app versions"". Habitica responded: HabitRPG, Inc.December 23, 2020 Hi AFK, thanks for your review! If you'd like to share any further feedback, please feel free to reach out via Menu - About - Send Feedback. Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That ""About"" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the ""Send feedback"" does not even exist in the app. It's called ""Report a bug"". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also ""Report A Bug"" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all.

I can't delete tasks, I can't edit tasks that were premade by the app. 2-3 basic features are missing. I'll change the rating to 5 stars once it is fixed. No, I'll not contact your team or email them the problem. It is basic and you should just fix the goddamn app. Edit : I have updated it from 2 to 4 stars cause major bugs have been fixed. Will make it 5 if the experience continues.",4,2020-11-22 04:03:20
Sietske van Vugt,"I've only just started using this app, but I already love it! It actually makes me want to do my chores so I can level up and earn stuff 🙃 Only minor bugbears so far are the American date notation and the reminder clock being an am/pm one. Wish I could change those to the usual settings we use here (dd/mm/yy and 24h clock). Especially the date is really confusing..",4,2020-11-11 22:51:28
Lipip24,"app like this was so great! organizing your task, to-do list, habits! plus a character like you, like if you didn't completed a task your character is like damaging, is like in actual life of how productive you are! but there's one thing that i don't like this app , is sometimes there's an bug like if you have another new task to type and you click save? it wasn't saving , it keeps running in a circle and i must reset the app like you should close this app and run it again! would you pls?",4,2020-11-19 03:54:46
Aalhad Sawane,Just change the colour of delete/save button in dark theme and I'll recommend this app to everyone I know. Edit 1: They fixed it. Very happy that the devs are so active. I've recommended this app to many people. If you could somehow enable inviting people to parties through links then I'd invite even more friends (as sending a link on my group chat is way easier than emailing everyone individually). Really looking forward to this essential and much needed feature.,4,2020-11-03 13:37:16

Sanjay M Bhaskar,I really enjoy the app and it helps in keeping up with the goals. Congrats to the team Habitica for this creation. I'm rating it 4 because there are still bugs exists and I'm not satisfied with the idea of 'only team leader can end a quest in order to for someone to leave the party'. I was invited to a party by a friend and then he stopped using it when we grew apart which made me trapped in the party not able to finish a quest. I had to delete my account and restart for keep going. :(,4,2020-09-17 07:00:57

Monica RR,"It's a cool app, but I wished there was a way to know how much you have improved week by week or a similar record. It doesn't really push you to improve, just to do something, if you do less than before, it's ok, you just advance slower and you keep going slow. It would motivate me more to try and do better than the last day or the last week, but I wouldn't know how that was unless I took a screenshot :/",4,2020-10-03 03:51:28
Raphael Pio,"Just installed yesterday and have used it for a whole day. The app is very helpful is setting concrete habits to reinforce or discourage and comes in the familiar set up of a video game. I'd definitely recommend this to others who are trying to develop themselves. One minor issue is that in some dark app themes, the delete and save button can't be seen because the text and background have the same color. Other than that, the app works fine.",4,2020-10-08 08:47:43
Megan Davis,"I love the new dark mode, I use dark mode for everything so this is much appreciated. The design has been streamlined and it's easy to use.

Random Measures,"The graphics are adorable, and the UI is clean. There were a few things that were a little confusing to find, but there's a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the FAQ. The only reason it doesn't work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression. Other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path, which feels more like moving forward. Cute app, but more for those who like armor building in MMOs.",4,2020-10-23 11:10:37

Brett C,"I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3.

Veronica Quimbo,"I've been using this app since the beginning of December and it has really helped me with keeping on track with tasks and developing habits. However, there are a few issues with the party features. When a message is sent in the chat, no one is notified and we cannot respond appropriately unless we actively check. The chat and members tab also tends to not load up and I have to leave the app in order for it to work again. Navigating the app is also quite a hassle but it isn't a major issue.",4,2018-12-26 14:54:02
VengfulDeathCow,"This is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers. The idea, the execution, the design, amazing.

Angel Wuff,"The app is a great concept helping me keep track of goals and be motivated to do the things I need to in a day. Friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging. Quests are wonderful long term motivation, along with the goal of filling the stable. It is discouraging, frustrating and hurtful when I try to check off dailies (or do ANYTHING on the app) and it doesn't let me because of connection failures. I lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies? Especially frustrating during quests. Myself and friends all have the ""connection problems"" in different locations on data, or wifi at the same time... Fixes are quick, and interactions/responses pleasant! Great app!",4,2018-10-13 22:21:14
jae p,"love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.",4,2019-06-06 02:27:21
Magnus G.,"I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix.

Kathy Swords,"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!",4,2019-12-31 02:38:18
Rebekah Perry,"A really great idea with a lot of great features! I love it a lot. However, it's a bit unresponsive at times.

Amy Skribble,"This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.",4,2020-06-23 09:33:33
Sarah Raulerson,"I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing.

You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.",4,2020-02-17 14:47:22
John Allen,"Guys - I really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars! Everything is there and I can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much! But on Android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks. The keyboard comes up but closes immediately so I can't do anything. The dailies work fine.

S,"A fun way to get into habits. Makes me want to do things in real life as I find it very rewarding. I think it would be helpful if there was a timestamp on the dailies/habits as to when you last checked the item off. I don't have the best memory and feel like some days I double up on certain tasks because I can't remember if I've checked it off or not alredy 😅 I would like to see how long it has been since I last did a task, again, I often forget.

Abdul Rahman,"I have been using Habitica for quite some time now and i must say, it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day. HOWEVER, the To-Dos are very limited in its functions. It's hard to implement a full task management (such as GTD methodology). It pretty much only supports next action steps, not any layers such as Projects or Waiting For. Also, syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic I hope they will improve the To-Dos and make syncing smoother.",4,2019-10-13 23:25:23
Shanna Neumiller,"Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.",4,2020-03-31 19:10:39
Simon Ghoul,"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me.

Vince Schiavone,"A little buggy sometimes but all is forgiven for how much this app helps me be a more productive and motivated person. I have one request, please add some sort of real life stat tracker.

For example, this would be cool for me to keep track of my progress towards mastery as a woodworker or painter etc.",4,2019-03-07 04:18:46
Garrett Michael,"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.",4,2020-01-04 18:51:22
Michelle Levashenko,"I have used Habitica for a year now, and I would suggest this app to anyone who wants to meet people with the same goal of building healthy habits.

Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",4,2019-10-23 14:52:31
A Google user,"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much.

Integration of calendar events would also be nice.",4,2019-03-01 04:43:44
rex juigamon,"Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app",4,2020-05-21 04:25:01
Lori Hildebrandt,Great concept. Reminders do not work and from some quick research it appears this has been an issue for literal years now.

I'd really appreciate if reminders would actually work.,4,2019-01-02 00:27:44
Carly Kalkauski,"This is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place. I think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it. My critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds you're in, you have to get on your desktop. This is super annoying because I'd rather only use the mobile app. Fix this and it's an easy five stars.",4,2020-07-07 17:53:26
Monty Watson,"I only started using it yesterday, and so far it is interesting, and I think it will be useful. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but that isn't an option, so 4 it is, for now. I'd really like to see a better way to organize Dailies, preferably alphabetically, so tasks I tag as Morning will show up before Night (though admittedly, that wouldn't help if I labeled any 'Afternoon' or 'Noon').",4,2019-04-21 14:20:22
Amber Burns,"I love this app alot. theres just two things I would really love to see added. it would be great if you allowed us to choose to have a habit set up for like 3 times out of the week, without picking which days of the week. I also really wish I could have more than 4 habits, is there a way to do that? it's a great app, thanks so much",4,2019-05-10 03:16:22
Joel Macha,"Cool app, but I wish I could see everything I own at once. When I get a new item, I have to search every inventory screen to figure out where is went. Confusing for new players. Also, if you don't have a party, it's basically a checklist since all the gane modes are forced multiplayer.",4,2019-01-06 21:01:17
Moneesh Prathap,"The idea is good, but the app can be made better with some performance optimisation. For example, when I launch the app, it takes at least 3 seconds to synchronize and restart my habit list with the correct status. And all pop-ups only appear with a 2sec delay. Overall I like the idea, by I'm moving onto other habit tracker apps because this kind of gamification isn't for me :) Appreciate the app.",4,2018-12-31 00:41:13
Amber Harrington,"I've been using this app for about a year now, I think. I love keeping myself accountable, and tracking what I'm doing and what I'm not each day. Lately, I've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat, none of which mention me. I've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time. This is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars!",4,2019-11-16 11:22:00
Dolly Chen,"I LOVE habitica, however I m think the app misses a lot of functionality when compared with website. For example the challenges in a guild is not displayed and the task detail in challenges are also not displayed. I mainly used the web version, but it would be great if there are not much differences between the website and this app!",4,2018-11-19 00:30:21
Nicole Crawford,"Really enjoy the app, probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with. Also, please set up a system of 'weekly' tasks, currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised.",4,2019-05-27 21:25:03
Jinjer Markley,"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",4,2019-12-10 13:17:36
Jordan Davies,"I used this all the time before, and it was fun in the beginning, but got really tired of the low res graphics!

Navinya Sawarkar,"I love this app and all my friends use it and compete against each other. This is a brilliant concept! however the app seems a bit buggy. I was in beta programme and then I was unable to send invites or buy certain items. I thought it's because of beta being unstable so I opted out of beta and reinstalled the app, still didn't fix the issue. I'm the party leader and the group isnset so that only I can start quests, still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and I don't face this on browser.",4,2020-05-04 05:13:28
Douglas Carvajal Calderín,This app it's amazing.,4,2021-01-13 01:42:08
flower child,"Pretty good app overall. I don't have many complaints since I've had it for just about a week. I have ADHD and can't just write stuff down because I lack the motivation to do something if there's no reward. With this, I can easily see what I need to do and get immediate rewards for doing something (woo hoo! dopamine boost!) which is good for my overall mental health (I have depression & anxiety as well). I do wish there was a timeline feature to see what I've done, but this works great so far.",4,2021-01-11 16:29:40
Kevin Zheng,"Didn't use it for main gimmick, the rpg stuff, just some task and habits. It works fine, but there are pop ups almost everyday informing about stuff I don't care about and I don't know how to turn it off.",4,2021-01-06 04:51:48
Bianca Liebenberg,"I really like this app, however, could use a tweak: After the day is done, I want to see what's completed. It would be great if there were a timeline page which keeps score of all the completed tasks in a scroll down bar organised day by day. Sometimes I accidently click a task, it would be good to be able retrieve it and restore it from this logbook as well.",4,2021-01-05 00:23:44
Eva Elisaveta,Amazing app. But stoped using it since I have a bad Internet connection. Really think that most of the app could be offline.,4,2021-01-04 14:32:25
The Dess,"I hate the gem system. I absolutely love the app and I've had a generally positive experience. I really think it's one of a kind and gamifying activities is the future. I've been playing for a while and I'm at a pretty high level now, but I can't help to notice that there isn't much left to do at the point that I am. Sure I can level up to infinity. Sure I can talk to people. But there is a lot of repetitiveness and I probably won't stick around for too long. It's too frustrating. The only thing left is to buy fun things with gems so that I can get gold, experience, and some cool rare items. So I decided to grind challenges. And I really did! Actual IRL GRINDING. The result - nothing at all. Why? Because Challenge rewards are luck based and/or rigged most of the time. Sure I did a lotta stuff IRL but not getting rewarded for it in-game kinda ruined it. I don't blame the devs for how Challenge rewards work at all, since rewarding depends on whoever creates the Challenges. But I do think there should be more ways to get gems without paying money. Paying IRL money becomes the only way to continue to have fun at a higher level. That's never a good thing if you want people to stick around. Here are some examples of instances where gem rewards can be implemented: when reaching a certain level, when completing difficult achievements, at a certain number of check-ins, through special in-game events (not RNG based events but events based on the actual effort that you put into tasks, for example). Rewarding the players' efforts is the best way to make them stick around. A balanced relationship between the value of the currency in-game and how difficult it is to get will never stop people from buying it with real money. In many cases it does the opposite. BUT It will also motivate people to progress and continue playing. It's a win win. A lotta people on the app preach the ""it's all about enjoying and improving yourself"" mentality. Sure, but if the aesthetic goal is to ""gamify"" your daily tasks, the app needs to behave like a game, right? And good replayable games are not repetitive and always reward hard work. This might be a bad take and I might be alone on this one but regardless I hope my feedback is useful! and yes, I have no life",4,2021-01-04 14:06:45

Rachel Riley,"I really love this app! Overall I've found it really helpful and it kept me motivated to do tasks I needed to do.

Daisy L,"I like this app. It helps. But there's one thing I hope it could improve: every time when I go to the ""dailies"" page, I have to re-choose ""show the due tasks"" to see what haven't been done. Why it can't remember my choice? I always just want to see what haven't been done yet, cuz I have a lot of items on that page.",4,2020-12-24 16:10:05
AFK Toodles,"Accidentally pasted over my original comment which said ""I love Habitica, only wished they would be more consistent in their options and naming conventions between the desktop and app versions"". Habitica responded: HabitRPG, Inc.December 23, 2020 Hi AFK, thanks for your review! If you'd like to share any further feedback, please feel free to reach out via Menu - About - Send Feedback. Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That ""About"" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the ""Send feedback"" does not even exist in the app. It's called ""Report a bug"". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also ""Report A Bug"" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all. It's gotta count for something.",4,2020-12-24 09:34:03

やまぐちやKamatari,"Been using it for months, but this app has changed my life. Giving it 4 stars because the feature isn't as rich as the web version, like the ability to see another account's photos, see more challenges at guilds or party... and also, when I open the app from the notification bar, it crashed, but it won't make me take another star.

John Timmons,I give this app 4 stars. It is a decent app of its type the only thing I can say I am a little disappointed in is you have no skills that you can level up. Oh there are stats but from what I can see you dictate where the points go so you can effectively increase a stat that has nothing to do with the job you've done. That said it has some pretty cool features and a very friendly chatroom which no other app of its type has.,4,2020-12-08 20:34:13

Random Measures,"The graphics are adorable, and the UI is clean. There were a few things that were a little confusing to find, but there's a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the FAQ.

The app still has some glitches here and there, but I mostly use the website.",4,2020-06-20 16:40:57

Moritz Scholz,"Great Concept, good community functions but some additional advice/tutorial and examples for planning your day / tasks with this app would be great",4,2020-06-03 13:36:09
Wian van Zyl,This app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists. However I would like options to customizer the avatar more? Like I accidentally added glasses and there isn't a option for none. Can you please add it?,4,2020-06-02 14:59:52
A A,This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.,4,2020-05-28 16:55:08
Lai Wong,I wish there was more interaction with party quests,4,2020-05-24 21:00:52
Javier Villegas,"Great to-do list app with addicting premise, but can't remove glasses customization option once they're on. Please change this! I don't want my avatar to have glasses and can't remove them since the option doesn't appear to let me do so. Will change review to 5 stars once this is fixed",4,2020-05-22 10:26:38
rex juigamon,"Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app",4,2020-05-21 04:25:01
Kasia Wójcik,"Great app! Finally something that motivates me. And you don't have to pay to use it :) One comment: I wish dragging and dropping tasks used the same solution as dragging and dropping items in a checklist. The way it is now makes it work inconsistently, because sometimes the interface thinks I want to scroll through the list and not move items around; because of this, it can be quite frustrating, and I move tasks around often to set or update my priorities. Other than that, great! great! great!",5,2020-12-21 20:49:20
Marc Kaufman,"Really full-featured and continually-supported app. I just need to stick to it. I dropped it for a few months after I got a new phone and hesitated to download it again, largely because I wanted an app that had a dark mode and this never had that. But I decided to re-download it anyway, and it does indeed have a dark mode now. I would suggest the developer add new pictures on the Play Store to acknowledge this!",5,2020-12-26 16:18:39
Joanna Severino,"I have been struggling with organization and productivity lately, and this app is the answer to my prayers. I love RPGs, so the layout of this app helps me stay motivated to complete my tasks and stick with my habits.

Glen Baker,"Much simpler and quicker to use than DoItNow or LifeRPG, with most of the benefits. I'm not so much a fan of the online-related stuff, mostly feels like monetisation to me, but it's not too pushy. Good todo app with good ROG aspect.",5,2020-12-20 23:37:46
jungjikook from bts,"Some bugs such as not being able to edit your tasks etc without the app crashing and restarting. Other than that, it's made life more enjoyable for me, especially in regards to living sober without being ultra bored.",5,2020-12-27 11:56:23
Youraveragegamer,Absolutely amazing changed my life. Just one suggestion add something where you can have a habit to go on the app and reward people for logging in because this is amazing but I need to remember to log in to tick stuff which I often forget to do but either way amazing app.,5,2021-01-01 23:49:24
YoungDeku,No ads popping up. It's free. I enjoy the community encouragement and tips. It's rewarding. Easy to use and edit. Has all I need in one place. Recommended.,5,2021-01-12 06:36:44
Gabrielle Pham,"I like the aesthetics, but it would be more convenient if I can default the to-do to scheduled rather than active. But also it's a good thing this app has a website version too.",5,2020-12-18 09:25:43
Jeremy and Andrea Harbaugh,This is such a great idea. I am a teacher and I was looking for ways to motivate my students. I didn't expect to love this for myself. My husband and I are working on household and self care goals and having fun. It's amazing!,5,2021-01-07 05:33:40

Mike Bianchini,"This is an amazing app - not just for the app itself, but the huge community behind it. There are so many people involved in this, both the developers of the app, as well as the user community that steps in to help. One of the best examples of the loving support is that even after I stopped being a paid customer, they took the time to help address and fix an issue I was having with my account. This helps me be a better person!",5,2020-12-26 22:30:54

Candee Cosplay,"I initially gave this a 1 star because it didnt work at all on the galaxy note 10 lite. After messaging the devs, they fixed the issue within a couple of days. Now the mobile app is as good as the desktop version. Thank you all so much for your amazing hard work. This app is changing my life. Highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to improve their life.",5,2020-11-02 16:58:03
Connor,"Very good overall but I'd still like to see some improvements. It would be nice if you could get notifications for 5000+ member guilds, I wish you could more easily sort through challenges and leave ones that have ended (and delete tasks from expired challenges), and have the app automatically delete to-dos once you've completed them so you don't see old completed ones in the task list. Having more options for equipment to wear would also be appreciated.",5,2020-12-10 01:47:34
Simon Hebert,"Makes daily chores feel like a game. Habitica has this thing where you collect an extensive list of gears and animal companion when you complete tasks. I love collecting items, so choosing the rogue class out of the other 3 is probably the best choice for me. There's so much more to it too :)",5,2020-10-22 03:58:50
Galactecis glasius,"I loved the app and it's concept. If I really needed a habit/task tracker or something of that sort. I would have loved to have this.

Sami,"Excellent App.. I honestly give this app the five stars. At first, When I couldn't understand this app... I didn't like it that much.. then gradually when I grasped the idea of parties, challenges eccetra I really enjoyed the way this app is created... plus please add 3d gaming characters and rewards and also voice chat feature.",5,2020-11-20 02:38:25
Laurence Hoehnle,"It's very motivating but it is a little bit buggy. Besides that, it's helped me a TON. I work put daily, keep up with personal hygiene and am in general just happier and more organized because of this app. Highly recommend",5,2020-11-29 22:26:25
Carol Zamboni,"The app is amazing, its really helping me with my tasks and habits. I just think that it would be very nice if the app had a ""history"" for us to see our perfomance in the week and the month",5,2020-11-01 11:59:35
John Beatty,"Really well designed for what I need, a To-Do List, Habits...and the RPG format is cool. Haven't explored fighting monsters but you get EXP and loose and gain health...pretty darn genius.",5,2020-12-01 01:05:28
Malik,Great app really helps you build good habits,5,2021-01-10 22:39:34
Stetson_Newsie,"I've only just started up, but this app has progressed so much since I last saw it! UI is really tidy and easy to use. It doesn't feel like everything is locked behind a paywall (though I plan to support). Tasks/rewards/etc. are easy to customize, so the game can be tailored to exactly what you need. I have ADHD, so an app that makes every task a fun/novel experience is fantastic. I'm hoping this becomes a well worn tool in my belt. Thanks to the devs for creating such a useful resource ❤",5,2020-08-12 19:33:25
M Sub,"It's a nice to do list app for me. Separating things into habits, dailies, and to do's isn't something I really thought about. So it's helped me plan what I want a bit better. I just wish there was a late night mode where it acts as if it's yesterday so you can accurately reminesce about what you did that day. I usually plan things out at night. Also turning a to do into a nice grocery list would be nice too. Trying to put it in the notes of a to do doesn't really work since you can't check.",5,2020-10-05 08:58:24
Viktor Hörnberg,This is an awesome way for me to keep the procrastinatior away :),5,2020-12-27 19:35:44
Hufflepufflez :3,"This is a very unique and interesting game, and it's really been helping me keep schedule during quarantine, which is amazing and really makes me happy, but it only gets four stars because sometimes it doesn't keep content. I used a royal purple hatching potion on one of my tiger eggs (I had two) and both items disappeared from my inventory but I didn't get my tiger, which is really disheartening. Very willing to fix this review if it suddenly shows up, but I don't think it will :[edit-fixed!!",5,2020-09-15 02:37:13
Hannah D. Rojales,"I love it :D I met great and fun people and this is the only to-do apps that really makes me do it or else I'll die oof. I love the concept and all but i kinda wish that there'll be more default costumes like the hair that is free, or some that can be bought by coins if possible. And maybe the background too? Anyways overall I love it, it was really effective for me. Keep up the good work, I'll look forward on it",5,2020-10-14 09:02:52
Stephen Vicentino,"I mostly use the custom prize. I use this app like a to-do list, that gives me money to buy that custom prize I set. Habits and dailies sections are great too. Apparently, your character can fight bosses and monsters too. You can also invite your friends or join groups to slay bosses and monsters, level up and improve together. Though I don't have a plan on slaying and upgrading stats, hatching pets are fine for me. Thanks.",5,2020-11-07 14:42:03
EJ De Guzman,"Edit: First of all thank you for taking the time to reply to my review, that is well appreciated for us end users. I cannot wait for the offline capability of the application to be implemented, I hope for that update to come as soon as possible. I will try to send my feedback.

Kwesi Owusu,"This app is really amazing! There are different categories to sort your tasks into to suit your particular needs. The RPG aspect is really well done: your productivity reflects on your avatar in a surprisingly immersive way. It's rich with a variety of items, equipment and cosmetic customisations for your avatar; the quest feature is a great way for people to socialise productively and hold each other accountable in a fun and creative way. I've never loved getting things done more!",5,2020-09-25 06:26:35
M. Perry,Fantastic Habit Forming App! The staff is so kind and helpful. My reading skill and general cleanliness are castle improved. I love forming a party with friends and doing all the little quests together.,5,2020-10-27 16:20:11
mecca law,"I LOVE THIS APP. It helps me so much when I want to get something done, and when I need to do something daily, like take my vitamins, or wash the dishes. There are also so much nice people when you join guilds. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Note: This app is way more helpful if you're into games, points, and competitiveness. (I'm very competitive 😅) But it's still super helpful even if you're not that interested in that stuff. Again, 10/10 would definitely recommend!",5,2020-08-14 15:21:48
Joshua Varghese,This is one of the best to do lists that I have used . Even Google's to do lists pales on comparison.I was surprised to find no constant ads or a pro mode which these things usually have. The widgets are almost perfect except for the hobbies make that 1x1 but it's a really good experience overall . I recommend using it . It helps a lot gamifying ur to do list makes you more eager to do them . Thank you for a to do list that is totally free . I definitely recommend this.,5,2020-09-29 06:52:25
TheOneTrueGriswel,"Useful, needs a good internet connection (I can do banking and then find that my connection is not good enough for Habitica). I have used this for well over two years and, even at work, it's a nice boost to my feeling of accomplishment when I get things done. Great co-op with family, too. Very responsive Devs.",5,2020-10-04 13:15:09
Anupam D Sarkar,"I noticed how obsessive I was about getting an achievement in some video game..Like a new gun, module etc. I would grind for ages... I thought what if I did this kind of work in real life? I would be so far ahead! So I thought to look for a Gamification app. Habiticia fit perfectly. I'm using the same ""obsessed"" attitude and all my thousands of hours of childhood ""training"" I have to achieve in video games games for achieving my daily habits. Thank you, you saved me. Instant 1 year sub.",5,2020-09-29 13:24:43
Aistė Butrimaitė,"I LOVE THIS APP VERY MUCH. When the quarantine started, I gained a few kilos, didn't exercise enough and would sit on my phone all day. When I found this app, I started to do things - even making habits that I want to have. Also, this app is also a semi-RPG game, so it's a really big plus. 5 stars, GUARANTEED.",5,2020-09-07 13:00:09
Apurva Rathod,"I really really love this app. The gamifying is really good. And I especially love the guilds with various creative monthly challenges. Another pro is that most people don't spend too much time chatting. The chatting is limited to a healthy amount (cuz ppl r busy with tasks) and it is still social enough to provide enough encouragement, sharing of thoughts and pointless banter to take ur mind off stressful stuff .",5,2020-08-23 14:23:54
Margarida Ribeiro,"One of the most flexible productivity apps I have used. Works as a Habit tracker, daily reminder list, and a To-Do list, which is great if you want to have an overview of all these things inside a single app. Makes your tasks feel less overwhelming by keeping the theme light and fun. The devs add new content to it constantly and the community is able to create guilds and challenges, offering a more social experience than most other productivity apps.",5,2020-10-05 10:06:32

I wish they had a search bar to search up challenge, maybe a group and create group button and way to invite friends and become friends with your real friends so you can do challenges together but I would totally reccomend this app download it now you will not regret it :)",5,2020-09-10 15:29:39

Truly a blessing of an app.",5,2020-10-10 08:43:15
Sally Simpson,"Edit: the app gets better with every update and I hadn't had any bugs for a while now. I absolutely love how it looks after the latest update - super clean and fresh. 5 stars and many thanks to the hardworking devs. Love habitica.

Dumblo Dore,By far the coolest darn app I have ever played in my life!! I love the whole concept of what is trying to be portrayed here.

Crystal Waters798,"Habitica has been a massive positive push in my life. I dont make alot of game reviews, but i kinda felt like i had to for this one. I have adhd and it mainly affects my executive function which gives me alot of issues with procrastinating and putting things off and letting things like my personal hygiene and im ashamed to admit this, but the care for my animals go. Having a place to manage all that with an immediate repercussion, even if digital has been a wonderful motivator",5,2020-10-10 06:28:45

I love the fact that if you want something, you've got to earn it, and it makes you feel good about completing tasks! It doesn't always tell you to rate the app and/or share it which is another plus. 11/10, I do recommend!",5,2020-09-11 21:16:03

There are so many people involved in this, both the developers of the app, as well as the user community that steps in to help.

I dropped it for a few months after I got a new phone and hesitated to download it again, largely because I wanted an app that had a dark mode and this never had that.

Ryuku Telvanni,"I've been using this app for over a year. It's a fun way to organise the things you want to do, and get them done. Gamifying tasks has been most fun with this app, compared to anything else I could find out there. You can group up with friends as well to defeat larger quests together. Definitely worth a try at the least. My biggest recommendation is to take a bit of time when you start out to really think of all of the big, and little things you really want to get done. Also, look up hard mode.",5,2020-12-26 14:12:10
Daphne Boydston,"Such a fun way to work on goals / habits, play, and connect with friends. I've used it off and on for years, but for about a year and a half as of my most current.

Kasia Wójcik,"Great app! Finally something that motivates me. And you don't have to pay to use it :) One comment: I wish dragging and dropping tasks used the same solution as dragging and dropping items in a checklist. The way it is now makes it work inconsistently, because sometimes the interface thinks I want to scroll through the list and not move items around; because of this, it can be quite frustrating, and I move tasks around often to set or update my priorities. Other than that, great! great! great!",5,2020-12-21 20:49:20

It would be nice if you could get notifications for 5000+ member guilds, I wish you could more easily sort through challenges and leave ones that have ended (and delete tasks from expired challenges), and have the app automatically delete to-dos once you've completed them so you don't see old completed ones in the task list.

Emma Parsons,"The apps good, I have had it for a long time and bought lots of trees, however recently the trees I bought were taken from me because they were now only available for pro users. As a long time user this was really sad, I really liked my trees!

Naihar Jamatia,I used to love it but the new update sucks. All those plants which i had are locked and they require pro version now to unlock.,1,2020-12-30 13:38:27
Belle Tagle,Why do I need to pay for the app to access my Pro account in a new device? Kinda hate it that I have to pay a few more times to lock my devices through the app. I hope Google Play Store and seekrtech would come to an agreement to pay just once for a Pro account like the WaterDo app where I can freely sync my account to all of my devices for paying just ONCE only.,1,2020-12-25 08:03:26

Eye candy,"I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have ""pro version"" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",1,2020-11-01 03:16:03
LL Smith,"I have been a regular user of the free version for a while and was constantly telling people about this great app. However, most of my previously unlocked trees disappeared after the most recent update and it appears this was intentional on the part of the developers. While I understand that this app is part of a business, it is very disappointing to have features stripped in this way and it does not motivate me to move to the pro version, it just burns the goodwill I had toward this company.",1,2020-11-15 23:11:31
Katty Kertomoro,"I've been using the forest app since 2017. Because of the new version update, the plants that I have bought on the old version from my collected coin can't be used now!!! Because these plants have been moved in the pro version section. This is not fair, it's really really difficult to collect all the coins on the old version forest app...... and now I want to use some of my plants for my pages, but I can't because I have to pay for the pro-version!!! Are u kidding me????",1,2020-12-04 02:49:27
Zi Xuan Yap,"Everything was good in the past until they take my trees away (that I had unlock it before the pro version tree come out) Really??? It was wrong so wrong.

Andrea Alvayero,"I'm upset with the latest update of the app. I get that the change must have been for the better for the creators, but taking away the already purchased trees was way too much.

I want my trees back.",1,2020-11-12 04:46:10
Yuki Calderon,"With the set of new updates, the app has become inconvenient. It doesn't notify you when the time is up, and they made all trees except the originals available only to those who get the paid version and randomly increased the prices of certain trees. Today, I lost all of my purchased trees in the app from the past 3-4 years. I do not want a refund in coins, I want my refund in trees. Purchasing new trees with coins from remaining focus was the point of this app. Very disappointed",1,2020-11-02 23:00:59
Liz,"Extremely disappointed to be stripped of my collection of trees I worked to build and to be left with a pitiful, unmotivating and highly limited collection (free user). While I understand the benefits of having ""pro"" only trees - it seems ridiculous existing users weren't grandfathered into this scheme. This appears like a rather manipulative money grab and leaves a foul taste in my mouth. I've been grateful for this app over the years, but this is something I can no longer support or recommend.",1,2020-12-22 01:29:31
Oscar Perez,"I have had this game for years and had all the trees. It was a great game until they added that terrible update. Everything besides the 4 normal trees were refunded and now blocked behind a stupid pay wall. I read other reviews and the devs are just copy and paste the same thing to them, or there just bots. But why! Why would you take away the main thing that keeps your players happy and entertained. I don't understand...",1,2020-11-12 11:16:22
Lali Reyes,"Good app if you're willing to pay the subscription, if not don't even install it. Used to be my fav as a free user, letting me buy cute trees by just using the app itself and watching some ads but now I'm uninstalling it as my past purchases were refunded (I wasn't even asked about it) so I'm stuck with 10000 coins without being able to buy stuff. Being a premium user should be an option.",1,2020-11-01 18:43:57
Missfluffykins s,"Was a great app that I used for years until the recent updates took away anything that I had bought since they moved mostly all of the content to a ""Pro version"", they also took away the main motivator of the app, as you can now freely exit the app without the timer stopping and your tree dying. This was literally the only reason I had the app as it really helped me study. The only way to change this is to buy it off them. I wouldn't reccomend this app to anyone.",1,2020-11-04 15:10:30
Brittani Howard,"I really enjoy the app, but you should do something about free users not being able to access/purchase all the trees, especially ones they've already unlocked! I'm a pro user, and I still don't see how that's fair to them.

アランソンオリビア,"I use to love this app and used it often to break phone addiction. However, the update has caused me to lose ALL of my previously unlocked trees! I've had this app for nearly 2 years to help study. I unlocked maple, willow, carnations, etc and they were all taken away?! I have lost motivation to keep using this app. I already understand that you updated it to handle piracy issues, but the result is that most people including myself are extremely disappointed.",1,2020-11-05 04:19:46
Harn-Yu Chiu,"I used to love this app so much but after the update I just want to uninstall it. Before the update every tree can be traded with the coins, but after the update almost every tree is the pro version. I'm extremely dissapointed with the updates. (newer update) We don't want refunds, we want our trees back. So many coins but there is nothing you can do with it!!! As a student, I don't want to spend any money on apps since I'm still dependent. And I'm going to look for an alternative app now.",1,2020-11-04 02:58:43
Tirthankar Ghosh,"Reducing my rating again. First they brought an update where you could buy trees only if you're premium. Now, with this update, whatever trees you did have before, everything is gone. You can't access tree YOU had ALREADY unlocked prior to the first update. Just say that this is a paid app. It doesn't make any sense to say this is a 'free app' when everything worthwhile needs to be paid. The worst part, this app went against their loyal users and took away stuff they rightfully unlocked",1,2020-11-02 03:59:54
Anusheah Ejaz,"I used this app all the time but the new version wants me to pay for a pro version to get trees I had previously gotten just by using the app. It has made using the app unpleasant because what used to be the fruit of my labour is now locked to me until I pay the app. In fact, getting those nice trees and bushes used to motivate me to focus for longer periods of time. It seems very unfair that only the plainest trees and bushes are left for the base version.",1,2020-12-22 12:51:29
armaan zakhir,I've been using this for a while now. But only one star. Just because most of the things in this app is free. We need to buy premium membership to unlock a lot of content. You can make limited event trees free right and you can buy money for diamonds. It's simply wants you to pay money to them. Otherwise it will be a five star app. If you can plzz make limited event trees free. Thank you,1,2020-11-11 13:30:57
Chen Lia,"They just change the terms without prior notification that the tree I brought which later became pro version are all dissapeared!

It feels really bad and I would never use this app ever again.",1,2020-11-06 21:04:46
Konstantina Nathanail,"I used to love this app, but the latest update has just ruined it for me. Not being able to use but 4 trees is annoying and shows that to the designers the possibility of profit is way more important that user experience. Claiming that this change has taken place to ""prevent pirated software"" is neither convincing nor logical, not to mention that due to the latest update *every* single time I open the app a new pop up message explaining the change appears, even though I've already read it.",1,2020-11-02 19:24:44
Catiuscia-Jade Pinto,"Honestly used to looove this app, I understand they are just trying to make money, but it already irritated me that they made most of the trees for the pro version only, but now they've even taken the trees that I already purchased away, this is ridiculous, you've lost me as a user because of this, and I'm not the only one, you've lost a lot of loyal app users Don't take away what we've worked so hard for, so annoying.",1,2020-11-03 19:42:35

Jhiny,"Editing my rating again (5★ to 4 and now to 1). I'm very disappointed with this app, the most fun thing about it was planting cool trees and getting more coins to get more trees. Now almost all trees are paid. The free trees are very limited and it gets very boring after unlocking them all. Very sad and disappointed. It was a great app back then. Now it's basically useless. Hope your team take a time to think about users experiences and give to free users a good experience as well.",1,2020-11-12 22:15:20

Paras Anand,This used to be such a great app... But since the new update we cannot purchase new species of trees... Additional to that the promotional adds have increased. The iOS users aren't paying a single penny extra for anything either pro version or having a group timer even all the species are available. This is not done... You have snatched the mere basic content of the app from Android users. Edit : Nov 2020 Great now even the trees we purchased earlier have been taken away too ! Wow masterstrok👎,1,2020-11-02 04:03:22

Niyathi,"Dear developers.. As you can see, lot of users are really disappointed at your recent update. This was an amazing app which helped me a lot...The whole enthusiasm of gaining coins and buying trees was the core catch in using this application..That very purpose has been removed right now..I don't think the reason of piracy you are citing is a genuine one.. It feels like, you are prompting us to be a pro member to enjoy the benefits of the app or else leave.. Sad to see this coming..",1,2020-11-18 10:56:15

To use Deep Focus which is essentially a big part of the app to being productive, you need to enable many settings of your phone. Disable battery optimisation, enabling it to read your text messages, notifications and data. This is concerning when previously they did not need to have this setting.

thierry klougbo,"This app was really great at the beginning. I really like the idea of it. But it has been some time now that I have started to notice some issues: - It has become very slow. Like it is not THAT slow, but for an app that is meant to be used all day long almost every day - I'm a full time student ;) - it does feel a little slow. - It has difficulties updating the time you spend studying in the ""friends"" window. My friends and I always have to go into the settings to make it update the time. Now I do not know if this is because of some android interrupt restrictions, but it would be great if you guys can fix this, because it simply makes the app less trustworthy. - Can we plzzzzz have more trees?? At the beginning the trees were very interesting to buy and to plant. But now I notice that even though most of the trees are fictional, they still are a little boring. And there aren't that many of them to begin with.",2,2020-12-27 13:18:24
Julchen Beilschmidt,"I really love the concept of this app and even bought the premium version, but for the last few days I was unable to open the app. I thought this might be because I was part of the Beta program, but even after I left the Beta I still couldn't open the app. Please fix this.",2,2021-01-12 13:57:03

Nina S,"((EDIT: I just availed the pro version, however, the coins were not the same when I switched to pro version. May I know how to get the coins lost? It was different with my other device. Thank you.)) Before, I would rate this app 5 stars. However, the new update made me rate it into 2 stars only.

Diane Olano,I bought the premium because I thought when you have access to all the trees.... no need to buy them with coins... I was wrong. I used this app back in college and even with the free version you get all the trees. What happened? Im really disappointed. I'll still use it bc I BOUGHT IT. I hope this feature changes or atleast make the trees cheaper in premium.,2,2021-01-05 04:21:44

Yellow Burrito,"It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",2,2020-10-31 01:59:30
Cara Lou Who,"Used to love this app. Was disappointed when they added a premium version and locked some trees, but I understand the decision. HOWEVER, they also took away trees that had already been purchased by people without premium accounts, which to me seems ridiculous. They did refund the coins, but now that I've unlocked all the trees with the free version, there's nothing to work for. Considering switching to another app.",2,2020-11-01 15:58:54
Rania Lillian,"Was a good app, but unfortunately they chipped away at the free version until it became pretty useless. First, limited the unlockable tree species, then removed access to previously unlocked ""premium"" trees (giving an unusable refund because so few non-premium trees are left), then, most annoyingly, inserted a pop up that tells you all of this every time you click anything at all. Wouldnt have bothered with the review, except for the pop up, which is more annoying than any ad.",2,2020-11-02 23:01:51
ella ritter,"i used to love this app! studying was a lot easier with the coin system, trading the ones you get for beautiful trees was more than enough to motivate me. however, these so called ""bug fixes"" have made those different tree options unavailable for non premium users. now, you're left with a very small amount of really simple and bland species.... such a shame.",2,2020-11-05 23:24:03
Lottie Fleming,"Very annoying! Before, I enjoyed having a reason to save up and earn more coins, meaning I also revised more, but it had an update which prevents me from buying the trees that I had saved up all my coins for, saying I could only have them if I got 'Pro' (paid version) The only ones available to me were ones that were either free or cost very little. What kind of motivation is that! If that wasn't bad enough, they took away the trees I had already worked hard to buy with the coins I saved up!",2,2020-11-15 09:55:41
Jude Smith,"Really frustrated by having most of my trees removed (all the cool ones) and shifted to ""pro only"". Sure, you refunded my coins. I'd rather have the trees thanks.

Ana Pizarro,"REALLY disappointed with the new update. I know it sounds ridiculous because the point of the app is to be able to focus but it was really satisfying to save up to buy my favourite tree, one I love in real life too.

Cristina Agustin,"I used to use this app a lot but after my board exam I had not used it in about a year. Now I come back to find most the trees I paid for are gone :( I don't think it's fair considering I spent so many hours on this app!

Maniac Mina,"I understand the implementing of a pro version, I understand giving it perks. What I don't understand is taking away previously unlocked trees (that were so much fun & rewarding to unlock). Those felt earned, you could have made those trees Pro-limited from here on out, without having to take them away from those who earned them already. That felt like a loss, & a betrayal... in less dramatic terms : it was rather upsetting 😕",2,2020-11-01 11:49:49
zhen kai gan,"I think that forest is ok because I always have a thought to unlock pro version. But, my mother does doesn't let me unlock pro version. But when you unlock pro version, you will unlock EVERY single thing in pro version, so I wonder why they need to put ""a rich variety of trees"" in pro version. Also, you need to enter a code to unlock new trees. ☹️This is what my sister said when SHE unlocked pro version. 😭So sad. I actually I got every single tree before this update, but now it's all GONE! 😡",2,2020-11-07 00:20:18
Elese Nguyen,"I'm pretty disappointed with this new update. I felt annoyed when some of my trees were lost because they are part of the membership version. This app is meant to be about progress, though it is harder to be motivated with a limited amount of plants to save up for.

İlkin Hüseynli,"The app is very useful but important parts that adds fun are really annoying: 1. I can't zoom or rotate my forest. Can't change place of trees. I would like to customize my forest. Trees appear randomly and after using for a month, there are many trees and the forest is so small that trees barely distinguishable. 2. Progress is slow: you have to do at least 30 180 minutes session in order to open 1 2k tree. 3. Some menu items are confusing: ex, allow list for deep mode, global ranking",2,2020-11-04 09:18:02

Shenelae Loreece Raton,"The update for November 2020 is not good. I really tried to save some coins to buy the trees I want.

Charlie Pandemos,"Worse than it used to be. This app is less about planting trees - why I downloaded it - and has become more and more complicated with less user reward and less focus on the real trees being planted. Plus, with only premium users being able to plant trees, I feel like I'm just giving money to the developers. For what it's worth, I'd rather use an app that doesn't pretend to be doing good.",2,2020-12-02 22:00:39

Anthony M. Barbieri,The app is only good because it does its function. The true reason i have given this two stars is because of their higher tree skins that have recently been made only unlocked with paying for the pro version.

Gairik Dey,"Does everything the app says and it's good. HOWEVER, you cannot restore your pro version no matter how much you try. Once you log out, your account is good as gone. Don't buy the pro version until they fix it.",2,2020-10-18 19:11:32
Termeh Tohidi,"I really loved this app. But I'm not happy with new version at all. It was motivational for me to focus more, gain more coins and buy expensive trees. But now you have omitted all of the interesting species for free version and it is not enjoyable for me any more. I live in Iran so I can not purchase the pro version and I am pretty sure I'm not alone in this. I hope you find away to get back everything to normal cause I am definitly in love with this app.",2,2020-10-17 11:09:15
Halooshka,"I don't mind giving pro users some advantages but this is too much! way too many tree species need to be unlocked with money now, and I looked forward to unlocking them!

Vanessa King,"This app has definitely helped me put my phone down, but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards. After using it for six months, I've run out of trees and plants to purchase, so there's not much more to ""add"" to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins. When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before.",2,2020-10-16 14:38:29
gia,"this app has become more and more money driven. as someone who has been using this for years and across multiple devices, this is really disappointing. more and more features that used to be free are being locked behind a paywall. hopefully someone comes out with a similar app because the concept is good but now everyth needs to be paid for.",2,2020-09-12 05:28:12
Shay Leigh,"I really enjoyed using this app until the September update forced all free users behind a paywall with just a few basic options.

I am not sure what to do with the coins earned since I have all the basic options.",2,2020-09-28 18:34:10
Habiba Hasan,"I used to love working with this aoo and it was helpful. But the recent update is frustrating. It sounds vast inequality among your paid and unpaid users. And it seems foolish to paid only for some species while you can get other effective apps for free. Mu aim is to upgrade my focus, not to buy trees. So really upset for this unfriendly update and yes, uninstalling it.",2,2020-09-07 03:12:34
Swastik Mishra,"The new update is worse. I used to love it but the new interface is not at all good. Almost 60% of the trees are now in the pro version, which leave almost nothing for the non pro version users. And the trees look very small which selection in the new layout. Previously it was good. I hope all these shall be rectified in the later versions",2,2020-09-19 03:31:00
Adhi Sankhla,I can't believe you guys locked all the good trees with premium. Students who are saving money can't spend it on apps. Purchasing new trees always gave me motivation boost.👎,2,2020-11-01 10:36:03
Michelle Dobbratz,"I wanted to like it, but many dealbreakers. No alarm at end of session. No way to automatically go between breaks and work sessions, no way to automatically alternate between short and long breaks, no way to customize alarms that signify end of session. Contacted premium support re: no alarm- no response. Also- when you enter your birthday to register for premium, it's in a calendar form- it's much easier to enter a birthday by typing mm/dd/yyyy or to use a drag down menu for m, d, and year.",2,2020-09-22 16:47:22
Alex Berkun,"I like the concept and have found a lot of utility out of the free version. I bought the pro version for 1.99 to show gratitude, but now I can't double the amount of in game currency I earn by watching an ad. You use the in game currency to buy different types of plants, and with pro, most plants are almost 10x the price. So with pro, you earn 50% in game currency and need 10x to buy most plants. That's 20x the time. Seems like a shameless way to try and hawk micro purchases of in game currency",2,2020-09-17 14:17:51
Tara Hall,"Great concept, but unfortunately have to uninstall as it's a data privacy risk. Our firewall detected (and blocked) hundreds of attempts to servers in China when the app was sitting open but idle. For its function, this app should be able to run locally without call outs unless there's an error state. Combine this with the permissions required, and it's too risky for my comfort.

Peter Duong,"Good app for productivity, however, privacy is a big concern. To use Deep Focus which is essentially a big part of the app to being productive, you need to enable many settings of your phone. Disable battery optimisation, enabling it to read your text messages, notifications and data. This is concerning when previously they did not need to have this setting. Also, it would be very great if we could earn the coins more faster. Even as a Pro user it is difficult to unlock the trees costing 1000.",2,2021-01-11 13:16:03

But, the recent update took away all the trees I had earned and asked me to pay to get them back. Tbh, I like Forest, but this isn't the right way to treat your long time user.

Diane Olano,I bought the premium because I thought when you have access to all the trees.... no need to buy them with coins... I was wrong.

I hope this feature changes or atleast make the trees cheaper in premium.,2,2021-01-05 04:21:44

thierry klougbo,"This app was really great at the beginning. I really like the idea of it. But it has been some time now that I have started to notice some issues: - It has become very slow. Like it is not THAT slow, but for an app that is meant to be used all day long almost every day - I'm a full time student ;) - it does feel a little slow. - It has difficulties updating the time you spend studying in the ""friends"" window. My friends and I always have to go into the settings to make it update the time. Now I do not know if this is because of some android interrupt restrictions, but it would be great if you guys can fix this, because it simply makes the app less trustworthy. - Can we plzzzzz have more trees?? At the beginning the trees were very interesting to buy and to plant. But now I notice that even though most of the trees are fictional, they still are a little boring.

I know it sounds ridiculous because the point of the app is to be able to focus but it was really satisfying to save up to buy my favourite tree, one I love in real life too. There should've be been some other membership trees, or a system where we got to keep our trees, it's unfair to just take them away.",2,2020-11-14 15:53:20
Shauna Northup,"UPDATED TO 2 STARS I am frustrated. I used to enjoy using this app, as I am a chronic procrastinator and Forest helped me stay focused during study blocks. However, they keep removing features from the free version and making them premium only. I was honestly considering upgrading to premium before the updates, but this move just feels like an attempt to grab more money. All of my favorite trees are now locked to premium users only. It just feels slimy. I'll keep my money, thanks.",2,2020-11-13 19:36:12
Rica Cabahug,i really like the app but i rlly wish i shouldnt have updated it. now my pretty tress are gone which sucks (T~T),2,2020-11-13 14:12:18
fcrnd,"I bought premium without thinking much because I liked the concept, but after using the app I regret because it only times the period of focus, and doesn't allow you to time your rest time... so I have to count or do it manually again with forest and is so annoying. I wish I could set a schedule like ""40min focus, 5min rest, 40min focus, 10, rest"" etc... I bought this app but I'm using another one that allows me to do this....",2,2020-11-12 14:44:56

Ritobrata Ghosh,"Way too bloated for a timer app. I know it has a good-looking UI, but it takes up huge amount of space. A timer app shouldn't be this big, even if there are bells and whistles. Now I use a pomodoro app which takes up less than 5 MB.",2,2020-11-10 19:58:12
Stefan Cristea,It is just some app that locks your phone. The only reason I kept using it was because of the skins I unlocked. They took that away with the pro version so there's no reason to use the app anymore.,2,2020-11-10 08:26:23

Min n,"..... I loves this app but after the updste my previously unlocked trees are now taken from me. What the hell... How is this still fun then?? I studied so much to unlock these trees. Creating a pretty garden was part of my motivation for studying. I read before about your reason for doing this, but honestly I think it just sucks. I think I'll find a different study app.",2,2020-11-09 20:20:33
Aditya Tiwari,i am unable to open this app in my phone why is this happening i can't understand why is it not opening as my phone is a fully functional phone so please fix this problem as this is a good app my friend has shown me how this app works abd i like it so i will request you to fix this problem,2,2020-11-09 11:24:32
Henrieke Groenendijk,"Someone help me. I've purchased a premium account via Ideal banking. I've paid 2,09, but I don't see signs of premium account anywhere, and the app says that I have to buy premium even though I already did that. I have tried restarting my phone but it didn't help. What do I do to get the premium account I paid for?",2,2020-11-08 19:53:49
Cristina Agustin,"I used to use this app a lot but after my board exam I had not used it in about a year. Now I come back to find most the trees I paid for are gone :( I don't think it's fair considering I spent so many hours on this app! I would've been willing to pay for pro to unlock the other trees I had not gotten before, but I feel pretty cheated now. Don't think I'll use this app again.",2,2020-11-08 09:13:33
Alex Clark,"At first I really liked this app, but then I started seeing a ton of inappropriate ads. Every time I planted a tree the app would show an inappropriate ad. Deleted the app because of this.",2,2020-11-07 18:37:53
Pol Joshua Barte,this app is very great and it can really help me focus but I just uninstalled this app because why does the allow list feature on pro version I was really excited because this app looks so convenient... I don't have money and I live in our country where it costs 100 for the pro version. I just wanna focus on my studies easier...,2,2020-11-07 03:42:50
zhen kai gan,"I think that forest is ok because I always have a thought to unlock pro version. But, my mother does doesn't let me unlock pro version. But when you unlock pro version, you will unlock EVERY single thing in pro version, so I wonder why they need to put ""a rich variety of trees"" in pro version. Also, you need to enter a code to unlock new trees. ☹️This is what my sister said when SHE unlocked pro version. 😭So sad. I actually I got every single tree before this update, but now it's all GONE! 😡",2,2020-11-07 00:20:18
Anthony M. Barbieri,The app is only good because it does its function. The true reason i have given this two stars is because of their higher tree skins that have recently been made only unlocked with paying for the pro version. I didn't take much issue to it until they removed the higher tree skins i had already unlocked before they were only available in the pro version. I liked when more unique tree skins were available without need of a pro account because that was what kept me motivated to keep using the app.,2,2020-11-06 21:11:38
Lets Do Together!,It's a nice app for productivity. I have been using a few days and I have faced an certain issue which is that the music in the app which you turn on during your time doesn't shut off after the time is achieved.... the music continued on thus making delete the app consequently. Please look through the problem.,3,2021-01-03 09:10:41
Ricardo Casares,"A very original app, love the idea. Its also very intuitive and simple to use. The pro version is cheap too. The problem is, just like almost every other similar apps, theres ways to outsmart the block and lose your focus again...and in this app is quite easy to do!",3,2021-01-03 17:41:21

Vibhuti Pathak,Tbh this app isn't what most of us want.... its just a timer which u can access to with ur clock too .... if you want smth u need to pay ......... I don't think it will ever be able meet my expectations..... not what I wanted...,3,2021-01-08 09:08:32
Ritika Nunach,Firstly I like this app so much. But There were few trees for free version.after buying all the trees of free version. it become boring app .more trees inspire to buy it .and concentration power increase . please provide more trees pleaseeee.,3,2021-01-02 07:36:00
Krutz,I am pro user. App sometimes crashes while using the white noise it does not get off even after switching it off and even it is better if timer has landscape mode too.Please let the snow to be falling like that for the whole time till the tree grows it gives soothing experience .If these problem are fixed then I will give this app 5 stars because it is very nice app only these problem are in this app.,3,2020-12-24 12:35:12
Semyon Chernykh,"So i figured, after i reinstalled the app, my settings were changed, now it's back to normal so update is okay, though my time was counted towards the guardian tree only when I was on data and didn't when on WiFi so 3 stars",3,2020-12-28 03:23:13
Jeffery MacDonald,"Amazing support team, and helpful app. But there are issues when trying to create a room with my girlfriend in the next state, and the app is overall a bit laggy, and difficult to manage. However, it can be as a simple as you want it to be. I really enjoy the deep focus mode, and the ability to set apps i need to use. Would like to see more future features for friends (forest viewing, comments, sharing messages when the trees are planting, et cetera).",3,2020-11-17 18:43:33
Chinmaya Biswal,"Need more customisation. Right now the completion notification just generates a generic tone which is easy to miss. As a pro user what I can really use is to be able to define a big 'dong' sound that makes sure I am notified, or a constant tick or screen flashes. Otherwise the app is great. But the core functionality to help the user track time is a little lacking in terms of how notification works. On pixel2 sometimes the notification doesn't sound. Have to restart app.",3,2020-12-20 17:07:07
Céline Quinn,"It's been really nice to focus and see my forest grow. Especially for chore tasks, it helps keep me focused. I don't usually spend money on apps but this one is worth. Only issue: YouTube is not on the allow list and it's the only app I use while I work/clean to keep me focused. Can it be added? YouTube music is there but not YouTube. Without it, I can't optimize the use of this app. Thank you!",3,2020-11-23 14:50:27
Michaela Stephanie,"I love the idea but I tried to use this app a long time ago, and sadly didn't work well for me. Planting for 1 hour or two is way too long for me, I can't concentrate that long so I ended up just giving up midway. But planting for only 30 minutes will risk me going to other apps for too long before planting another tree, or just forgot to plant another. So, i think it would be nice if there is pomodoro mode. It will be a big help for people with short concentration range like me.",3,2020-12-15 14:45:19
Jason yuchen Liu,"Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it.",3,2020-10-30 18:36:00
Isressi Stay,"This app is quite useful, but they took away the tree types that we had bought before limited was introduced. That's like punching a person in the gut and then stealing their icecream that they had slaved away to afford, just because they no longer owned the latest and most expensive pair of shoes. What kind of sick power play is this??? Not happy Jan...",3,2020-11-01 10:55:25
Madison Oittinen-Frost,"Annoying pop-up messages! I like this app for productivity - its motivating to keep your trees alive. HOWEVER theres now this really annoying pop-up message that occurs every time I open the app and after every single focus period is completed. ""New Mechanism Announcement."" I'm unsure if this is a bug or attempting to annoy people into purchasing premium. Either way, super aggravating and it might drive me to using other productivity apps instead.",3,2020-11-01 19:48:38
Ky,"I love this app! I've been using it for about a year now and I have over 30,000 coins! However, I cant use this coins to fer anything. I bought everything I can in the store (with the free version. There is now a more complex pro version). I'm the type of person who is very much a reward type person, so when the rewards aren't able to do anything, I dont feel as interested in this app.",3,2020-12-23 18:11:43
Nicola Ellen Illustration,I love this app and it does keep me off my app. However I am so disappointed that pretty much all of the best trees have now been changed to be exclusively for those that have the pro version. So I have been given back 7000 credits and all my access to these fancy trees taken off me. Saving up your coins to pick a new fancy tree was a great incentive to keep off your phone and now I'm being told I can't have access to these unless I pay for the app. Very poor!,3,2020-11-02 09:23:41
Pia Cinco - Group 7B,"Used to be 5 stars but recently, after the notification about premium users having trouble restoring their purchases popped up, the app crashes everytime I receive an invite in the Plant Together mode. It's really annoying but I don't want to uninstall the app and reinstall it because I might not be able to restore my purchases after logging in. The app is updated on my phone so I don't know how to fix this.",3,2020-11-07 20:18:57
DoodleDan,"Would love to see a way to import and buy custom trees, after so many months of using the app, the experience is very bland.

cat pee,"I loved the app at first but then it all went downhill for me when I discovered that if you close the Forest tab on your phone, you will not be affected and it will not tell you to go back to work. You'll be free to procrastinate and that kind of ruined it for me and made me delete the app. Hopefully this will be fixed.",3,2020-11-22 01:29:35
irem akkoyunoğlu,"Great for its sole purpose but if you want it to be anything else than a time management tool, like a fancier interface and even features like saving progress, the app is basically forcing you to pay. There's no other way. I get that developers need to earn money somehow but you could've been more user friendly.",3,2020-11-10 21:42:55
Platax aka. Martha,"I like the whole idea. It's really motivating to keep earning coins for new sounds an trees. But I do find it very unrelaxing for the sound to stop and start very suddenly. I'd say 800ms is my sweet spot, better yet: let the user freely imput a fade-in/out time! You could make it a pro feature or something",3,2020-11-22 21:53:58
Jenny Kaye,"Amazing app. Works incredibly well and tree variety very pretty (if you're willing to pay!). But I'm absolutely livid that after using this app for years and slowly buying many trees I'm suddenly limited to about 3. So disappointed as new update completely took the ""fun"" out of this app - will be looking for an alternative as can't stand this latest update",3,2020-11-01 11:26:02
Christine S,Enjoying the functionality so far. But I just signed up for an account (BC I couldn't buy the booster I wanted without one) and the app now syncs for every little thing I want to do!!! Please include an offline mode or a sync toggle. I only use it on my phone so everything now takes longer than it really needs to and uses up my data. Editing to add that the bottle of sunshine didn't triple my achievement reward points.,3,2020-12-07 08:16:23
Annajx24,"I was happy when I found this app years ago, then I remembered it again. It helps me personally and my studies but I didn't like how premium users only get to plant real trees :( Great marketing strategy but I hope Planting trees will be for everyone. Maybe it won't help you alot but it will help nature alot. Two dollars might be small for you but in my country it's alot. I like seeing my plants grow but thanks?",3,2020-12-06 07:29:55
Natasha Fong,"I really enjoyed using this app but after the upgrade, all the trees i purchased weren't available anymore because I'm using a free version.

L Raven,"I really liked this app and had bought quite a few of the more expensive trees, which they let us keep after they decided those would be part of the pro version.

Tasneem,"▶️In the free version you can: ♡plant in-game trees by studying. ♡buy plants up to nine, one of those is free. ♡see all the in-game trees you've built  by studying in the tab called 'forest'. But you have to unlock the premium version for detailed statistics. ♡use tags up to nine (study, sports, rest, unset etc..) you have to buy pro version for custom tags. ♡max timer is 120 minutes. Forest is...okay. i prefer to use another app called study bunny. It's adorable and free to use.☺🐇",3,2020-12-16 13:10:26
Tara Cameron,"I use Forest as a pomodoro timer. The app really helps me focus. However, 2 things could be improved to reach 5 stars: the plant together mode and the ad rewards system bug a lot. It often takes several tries for my friend and I to plant together and to launch the add at the end of a session. This breaks focus.",3,2020-11-02 10:50:38
Beatrice H.,It's quite nice but it would be better if the app didn't crash when you're working. It happened a few times I lost 71 minutes of work time today and 50 yesterday... It's not the end of the world but it's kind of unnerving,3,2020-12-16 14:35:00
Mahrukh Akhtar,"I would have given it 5 stars if only this new bug got fixed in a few hours, alas it has been more than 2 days and the system notification of the 11/1 trees update is haunting my app display. It's clashing with and erasing my hard earned focus trees/coins before I can claim them. Please fix it or I'm switching to another focus app. P.S. I didn't even unlock any of the pro-limited trees then why in the world are you spamming my app???",3,2020-11-02 22:53:32
Omar Faruk,"Hey guys, I use this app as a Pomodoro timer and find it lacks a 5 minute countdown as it is only limited to 10 mins as the minimum. If you could change that it would be perfect!

Mitrofan Cristina,"I really love this app, but after upgrading it to the pro version, not only I have lost most of my unlocked trees, but I have also started losing coins (3000-4000 coins) after a period of time of using the pro version, even though I didn't buy anything.",3,2020-12-11 09:21:53
Luna,"I used to love forest but it changed alot. It is usually my go to study/focus app but right now I'm disappointed.

Darina Trujillo-Ravinger,Edit: Got response from dev. Pirated software? The app itself is does what it promises but putting a paywall on a large part of it really drags it down. There's really no point to the coins anymore once you buy everything. Atleast add more free trees for special events or make it so you can watch ads to unlock stuff. Really miss my birb tree :(,3,2020-11-04 18:39:46
Ailsa Chen,"This app is good for just a timer, but there's a lot of extra features u can only unlock if u get the pro ver. There's rlly not a lot u can do with the normal one.

Rishab Lakhanpal. 1813,App is very good. But the new update makes it boring to use . There are no good trees in free category. Earlier there were some options but now it's not good and I have collected 5000 coins but that are of no use now..... Please bring some trees in free category also and something good to use coins like different themes to be unlocked by coins or any thing....

Kate Sedivy-Haley,"App was useful, but I was very disappointed when a large number of trees were moved to premium without warning. I had been saving up and watching extra ads for coins for weeks, and then found there was nothing I wanted to spend those coins on. It felt underhanded - I thought the deal was that I watch ads, app gets revenue, and I get a nice tree, but then that deal changed. If you're going to move features to premium it would be polite to warn users so they could spend saved coins first.",3,2020-10-27 18:27:25

Bit when the new update came out, almost all the time trees in the shop became available for premium users only :((. I've had this app for years now, but when this shift happened, I felt defeated. All the coins I've saved up we're pretty much useless after the update. Before I would have gave 5 stars but the new paywall really disappointed me and so many others.",3,2020-10-25 18:26:53
Nandan Sheernaly,"Great app but I think I may have found a problem. I don't know if this is phone-specific, but the app stops working when I clear all apps.

Liberty Fuchs,"This app used to be very useful to help me stay focused on studying, but now that I'm graduated and busier, I don't always have control over how long I'll be able to do a task for. Sometimes things come up and I can't stop my timer without ruining my tree. It would be nice if I could set a stopwatch sometimes instead of a timer when I want to focus for as long as I can and cannot guarantee how long that will be.",3,2020-10-25 18:26:25
Geneviève Houle,"Love the app and all the trees, but 2 negative sides 1- the goal is to put aside the phone and so get a wonderful and lush full forest . So why is it that if a set a 120 min strike I got 4 trees but if a do 12 times a 10 min strikes, I got 12 trees... See the problem here?!?! To be less focus get me more reward. Not coherent 2- What's the Crystal ?? Really, even after buying the PRO Version I should pay real money to have these trees?!?! Not gonna happen and deceiving",3,2020-10-27 03:23:40
sarah ghalib,"i used to love this app until the most recent update. you have to unlock the 'pro' version to buy most of the trees, which is very disappointing. i used to motivate myself by collecting money and buying an amazing tree, but now you can only buy small plants with the free version.",3,2020-10-19 13:39:31

Stitch Is Cute,"Disappointed when you change all beautiful plants to be available only after upgarding to pro version. It will only discourage people to download your app or even lose existing users.

Sabyasachi Sahu,"The App has a very good story behind the focus aspect and has gamified the whole concept.

Natasha Aliasas,"I love collecting different tree species, and was disappointed when I saw today that free users have been greatly limited to what species they can purchase leaving only little variety to choose from. Being able to earn for a tree species was one thing that motivated me to use the focus app which also aided in my studying, but now I can't get the other trees because I can't afford the pro version since saving money is more of a priority now this pandemic. Might look for a different app. :(",3,2020-09-08 17:11:57
Ian Garner,"I'm giving this app 3 stars right off the bat because of ad walls, but heres why. I understand that app developers need to make money somehow, but there are multiple ways to do it and this is not the right choice for an app about PRODUCTIVITY. Productivity is about managing your TIME. When your developer makes you sit and watch an ad its a waste. It is immediately sending the message that they do not care about your time, and therefore they dont care about your productivity. Just your money.",3,2020-09-10 16:12:19

Αλέξανδρος Γήσης,"I like the overall idea behind the app, but I think that it's becoming more of a distraction, than helping me stay focused. 1) I'd prefer to set pomodoro sessions with breaks between them, rather than having to do that manually everytime. 2) Also, I don't understand why there is not an alarm after each study session and I have to check when the time is over. 3) I don't like the way focus mode is designed.

If I click on a youtube notification, it will play and I can listen even though I can't interact and my vision is obscured by the overlay.

We had several trees unlocked that she liked and saved up the focus credits to unlock, but after the change to the new pro settings all of the saved up trees are gone. Thanks for the credits back I guess, but there's no point to them if I have to also upgrade the app just to get them again. Still a great app, had it a long time, just sad we couldn't keep what we had.",3,2021-01-03 19:54:42

Chinmaya Biswal,"Need more customisation. Right now the completion notification just generates a generic tone which is easy to miss. As a pro user what I can really use is to be able to define a big 'dong' sound that makes sure I am notified, or a constant tick or screen flashes. Otherwise the app is great. But the core functionality to help the user track time is a little lacking in terms of how notification works. On pixel2 sometimes the notification doesn't sound.

Planting for 1 hour or two is way too long for me, I can't concentrate that long so I ended up just giving up midway. But planting for only 30 minutes will risk me going to other apps for too long before planting another tree, or just forgot to plant another. So, i think it would be nice if there is pomodoro mode.

Aarushi Srivastava,"I've had this app for many years now and I thought it was a great 5 star app up until recently. The app is increasingly becoming pay to use only, and I had all my trees taken away from my collection.

Céline Quinn,"It's been really nice to focus and see my forest grow. Especially for chore tasks, it helps keep me focused. I don't usually spend money on apps but this one is worth. Only issue: YouTube is not on the allow list and it's the only app I use while I work/clean to keep me focused. Can it be added? YouTube music is there but not YouTube. Without it, I can't optimize the use of this app. Thank you!",3,2020-11-23 14:50:27
Harshini Damarla,Forest is a really nice app which gets things done in time and helps to focus but it would be nice add our own tags have the allow list in deep focus mode without needing to upgrade to pro. Overall its a pretty good app,3,2020-11-23 05:59:20

Darina Trujillo-Ravinger,Edit: Got response from dev. Pirated software? The app itself is does what it promises but putting a paywall on a large part of it really drags it down.

Saving up your coins to pick a new fancy tree was a great incentive to keep off your phone and now I'm being told I can't have access to these unless I pay for the app. Very poor!,3,2020-11-02 09:23:41

sarah ghalib,"i used to love this app until the most recent update. you have to unlock the 'pro' version to buy most of the trees, which is very disappointing. i used to motivate myself by collecting money and buying an amazing tree, but now you can only buy small plants with the free version.",3,2020-10-19 13:39:31
Stitch Is Cute,"Disappointed when you change all beautiful plants to be available only after upgarding to pro version. It will only discourage people to download your app or even lose existing users. Suddenly it's pointless for non-pro users to save coins, the purpose of helping us focus would also be hindered.",3,2020-10-19 09:35:07
Elle Mclauchlan,"It's such a great app! It's easy to focus with, and even blocks you when you leave the app. It even contributes towards the environment! My only problem is I think it should allow you to access apps related to your study, such as Quizlet, or Microsoft Teams. When I try to access them it blocks me, so I have to do my online study from a different device.",4,2021-01-08 10:55:04
yana,"I love this app! brings me much productivity and I kinda addicted to use this app😂 This app is more fun when you get along with friends to have study session together. But, it have some irritated bugs. When I join a session, waiting for the session to start, I off my phone. Then I come back after 30 minutes, my phone showed that the session hasn't start yet. when it actually has started. Pls fix there. It currently happened to me often",4,2021-01-10 08:34:43
Neha Dange,I just love this app . Because of this my concentration power really increased but recently I am facing a problem with sound . The sound don't work when I click on background music like rainforest . Overall it's a really good app but plzz try to fix this problem.,4,2021-01-02 14:50:36
Generall Gold,"This is a good app i ever found. But the reason why i don't give this app five star because this app is required money to upgrade to premium verson, and i don't like the way was going on there, actually i also wanted to unlock it but i have no money to buy😐😐🙄",4,2021-01-09 01:59:25
Jimin Bang,I loved this app. The reason I put a 4 star review (wish I could put 4.9) is the one thing that grates on me-there's no stopwatch option... That's about it. Thank you haha,4,2021-01-01 05:15:24
Yik Neng,"Absolutely this is a really good app for focusing. I suggest to increase number of coins collected each time as I need quite long time to plant a new tree or a real tree. Btw, all settings and feature of the app is really well!",4,2021-01-05 05:39:46
Hassan Tamer mourad,Great app if you really want to focus But I think it could be better to give us like an option to use studying apps like google classroom google translate etc. without getting out of the app AKA ( losing the tree) it is going to be a great update but generally it is a great app,4,2020-12-28 06:47:21
Jennifer Cheung,"It is a great app! I use it whenever I want to study and it makes me focus more on my work instead of being distracted. However, sometimes it has bugs and I cannot open the app. Overall, I quite like this app actually. Waiting for an update! :)",4,2020-12-26 04:30:36
Srijani,This is a pretty great app with a very creative concept. The only problem I face is that it only works in portrait mode. There are a lotta tablet users and I think it would be easier to use if the app worked in landscape mode as well.,4,2021-01-07 14:55:24
Madhumita Kar,"Well I only started using this app today and it's been 10 hours till now.But I feel confident and happy enough to write a positive review.This app is amazing and I discovered it on YouTube (cafe.studyy).I never gave it a try but I'm now finally using it.It helps me to be productive and it's super cute and motivating.The only bummer is that: in order to unlock more cute trees, I have to purchase the premium pack.Please include more trees to unlock with coins only.Everything else is great!! ☺️",4,2021-01-10 14:43:56

Michal Front,"The app is nice to use, and I'm definitely making better use of my day. Something to improve: switching automatically to ""plant together"" mode when you accept an invite. I lost several joint sessions like that, or it was just cumbersome if someone shared a link with me. I would also like to see more focus on the ""real forest"" part. Maybe achievements related to that? Also, more achievements would be nice :) After less than 2 months I got nearly all of them, except for the global chart ones.",4,2020-12-18 14:25:56

Kieran Louttit,"Great app but restricted. I love the app, bought it about a month ago. It does a great job of keeping me focused. I only have a few complaints. Firstly, I wish so many features weren't restricted to premium users. All the good trees, detailed stats and lots of other things are not accesable to free users. Secondly, there should be other ways to earn coins rather than just buying them with real money as it takes a long time and a lot of studying before you can buy more trees with coins you earn",4,2020-11-16 06:46:46
Ren Kudo,"I downloaded this app for the pomodoro aspect, and for that alone it's worth the asking price of $2 for the premium version. Love it, use it every day. My gripe is with the social aspect, which the app pushes really hard, but its implementation is frustrating. The way to add people to your friend list is to search for their e-mail addresses, which isn't great. Why can't I search by username or referral code? I don't want to share my e-mail address in public spaces, but there doesn't seem to be any way around it. Weirdly enough, you DO get a referral code (and it's what gets shared every time I tweet about my forest), but only five people can use it, and you can only use one other person's code. Plus the code is more about getting other people to download the app than it is adding them to your friend list. The only way to add friends is to know their e-mail. The app even has an achievement where you should get 30 friends, but I don't know a fraction of that many people with whom I'd be comfortable sharing my main address, even though I know a ton of people on social media who use Forest. If I'd known of this restriction beforehand, I would have signed up with a burner address instead.",4,2020-12-11 10:09:44
J.W,Really cute app and I love it. But I wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer? Take a short break then resume studying. It'll be really nice. edit: still nice but its boring now not gonna lie. And I find it so unfair that we have to pay again? For a more exquisite tree when we already did? My motivation just drops..my phone is an android and for some reason my profile pic is blurry. I changed it today and it's very blurry..not a huge problem but just wanted to let you know,4,2020-11-08 16:13:40
Axcel_MC,"Honestly, this app really helps students like me amidst this pandemic. The UI is user-friendly, the trees are cute and the mechanics are A-okay. I think there are still points that can be updated just like trees can have small animations, new forest landscapes and a bit of interaction with the forest. It may stray away from its purpose of focusing but the feeling of completion gives me satisfaction. Last is how free users access the types of trees. I'm sure that you don't want them to be lost.",4,2020-11-26 11:43:17
Raozee,I've been using forest for about a week or so and obviously in the past week I had very less screentime. The app in itself is really nice but it would have been better if the allow list feature was free. That's the only thing I would like to have in addition. For school work u need certain apps so those could be kept in the list. U can use other apps if the deep focus mode is not on but u know how social media is. You are bound to open them. Overall the app is really easy to use and good.,4,2020-12-10 03:42:53
brilli sushmi,It's very useful! The only problem is that we have to pay for almost all the features in the app...could have been free,4,2021-01-05 04:57:25

This is honestly ridiculous and borderline a scam.",4,2020-11-12 15:16:13
Nikki Nguyen,"Although I love the idea of this app, I sometimes don't know how long I'll work for, sometimes it takes less time than I originally planned, other times more. So I'd like it if there was also a stopwatch version where it'd count up instead as this would be super useful. The tree would wither when we switch out of the app or close it! PLEASE PLEASE CONSIDER!! 🙏🏻",4,2020-12-08 04:55:50
Archerz,"Really good one.. I would have given 5 stars, but the app gets glitchy at times and, the verification process for the exclusive tree has been going on for a very long time.

Only one feature is missing, I'd like to be able to rearrange my tags so I don't need to keep scrolling to click. Or at least be able to sort my tags, it's weird that after long time it doesn't have option of sorting/rearrange yet, I think this is only app I know that doesn't have it.",4,2020-11-23 05:51:31
radu,"I'm only giving 4 stars because it has a big problem that would be great to have a solution. Long story short, as long as you close all tabs opened in the background you should be able to enter any other app while your tree grows. It basically annihilates the purpose of the app. I'd be more than happy to give 5 stars if the problem will be solved. Moreover, that would increase the effectiveness of the app.",4,2020-11-21 23:30:05

anthony pucci,"Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",4,2020-10-29 18:21:42
Little Blue Bird,"It's quite a good app! I got my revision for my science exam done. In round about 30 minutes.

On the latest update though, the notification for the update keeps popping up ! normally you see these messages once bit it keeps appearing sometimes even stacking up the same notification. seems like a little bug to me and definitely takes you out of focus, pushing against the purpose of the app. Hoping it'll be fixed soon! Great job on the team behind Forest. Thank you.",4,2020-11-02 12:56:42
Blessy Bee,I love this app. It has indeed helped me to overcome my addiction of using phone. The only one thing is I would be happy if the App Allow list becomes free. Other features I am very happy and satisfied. Please make the app allow list free as it is very useful.,4,2020-12-08 02:41:36
Brianna B,"I really like this ap, but I was disappointed when I finally switched to the paid version and found there was no option to double coins after studying was completed.

Matthew Russell,Update: Developer fixed this within a day! :D Good app but currently broken. I have owned the premium version for a while now.

Dillon Tan,This app was the best until the developers decided to make all the pretty plants only available for premium users. Can't you just stick with the ads to earn money instead of putting a premium version? Because I'm telling you developers that many of us are unhappy about the new mechanism :(,4,2020-11-02 05:01:52
Nafisa Xec,I like this app. I use it a lot often these days to focus on my assignments and hopefully will be able to earn enough credits to plan a real tree. I think integrating a to-do list feature would be a really nice addition to the app :),4,2020-11-22 19:23:34
Shelly Seismundo,It's a good app and you can see your progress. Hmm I hope that you'll put the forest timer in the lock screen so I don't have to unlock my phone everytime I'm tempted to use it. Is there other available alarm for the timer when done? I'm using it in free mode and I really love it. I can change it to 5 stars if improved hehe thankk you.

Sam Romeyn,"It's alright, works fine. I just wish my trees would remain from day to day rather than reseting.

A Google user,Great app... I am a pro user and I have recently noticed that the trees in the apps continue to grow even though I have opened other apps that are not on the app allow list. I know it is for me to stay focused but I prefered the previous version where the app would give a warning notification to return to forest when I open an app that is not on the app allow list... Would be great it I could get some help regarding this matter.,4,2020-12-07 10:14:01
alloo zgetti,"This app is cute and makes me not scroll on my phone for hours, you have to pay to unlock some of the features that dont seem that worth it though but its well done because it appeals to the dopamine seeking behaviour that you have when you use your phone too much and then you have to go do other things instead",4,2020-11-15 02:19:18

C Y,Fun app that keeps track of your overall productivity with labels and in-depth stats! Would be amazing to have the function where we can message people in the app to organise forest room sessions.

You can also label times such as work, study, social, etc. Each planting session earns points to gain specialty trees & badges. Screen can be set to stay on or off during planting. TOTALLY worth the purchase price for me.",5,2020-12-27 15:27:34

Kartike Jain,"Best app on play store. I switched to old Android phone of my father just to download it for free😅. Best app, helps a lot in my studies. Thanks developers, i will definitely buy it's premium when i am adult enough😅",5,2021-01-12 16:28:16
Saumya Agarwal,Awesome app. Really helpful in concentrating. Doesn't let me get diverted. Background musics are also nice. Highly recommended.,5,2020-12-29 21:19:01

sone kin,"I just really like how the app allows me to focus. It gives me too much guilt to kill a tree so, I guess I just don't. I'm more focused on school work. :)",5,2021-01-03 16:29:57
Raffael Lucas,"Amazing and unique app, but with the new update, a can't open it on the google assistant...",5,2021-01-07 10:21:02

Adhithyakiran P,I like it very much but I need more updated I want more trees in offline that mean I want more trees please add the growth step of trees some trees did not grow and thank you for this app,5,2021-01-07 11:38:49
Suhani Fiske,This is an amazing app really helps with my studies and tasks to get done. Also helps in time management,5,2021-01-04 14:40:32
Maciej Stokłos,"The app is really good. It really helped me to boost my productivity. The one thing I would ask for is turning in and off your allow list for paid users. Sometimes I just want to block everything, but constatly changing evrything to blocked and allowed is pretty annoying. But except for that, everything is great.",5,2020-12-17 09:15:52
Pragya Deepak,This is really great app. I makes me focus on whatever work i do because i love nature and i feel baad if i lose the focus and make my tree or plant die. I dont want this to happen and will try to never to do it. I like the design of this app and the most important thing FOREST APP has planted thousand of trees with the help of us; the users. !!!,5,2020-12-19 09:46:24
Sharon Evans,"Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",5,2020-10-31 08:17:48
Baldelovar EisenHower,"I'm glad I always use this app when I study,it helps me focus soo well!I'd recommend this to a friend",5,2021-01-03 23:03:06
Rekha Dekakakati,"This is the best focus app. I didn't want to study because I can't keep my focus but after downloading it I am just finishing every work cause I don't want to let the tree die. When I want to see the phone my mind says the tree it is growing and I also love to buy new trees. They are so beautiful. That is why I work hard, keep my focus, earn coins and buy new trees. This excites me so much",5,2020-11-06 10:35:06
Fluffy Unicorn,I am so glad my friend introduced me to Forest. This helps me to focus on my studies. The trees are so cute. Makes studying fun and organising my time so much easier in general. I am having an issue though where I can't watch adverts to double my coins. I have planted three real trees with this app and hope to plant more!,5,2020-12-18 20:57:28
kim joonefole,Best help to cope with procrastination during online class and online working times I was never able to get rid of procrastination before but now I can . Even there are some facts I didn't like (as the block list and allow list is only for premium users) but I rather get other good services. It is great work but I still want to say that you provide allow list and block list functions for normal users because they are also giving their data to you and trusting you and I'm giving the whole 5.,5,2020-12-21 18:24:35
Sahib Noor Singh,App is perfect only thing is i use on my tablet it will be awesome if the app can run in landscape mode. Kindly add landscape mode . Thank you,5,2021-01-05 13:51:17
Cyma Shirazi,"Amazing app! So surprisingly motivating and helpful, I'm terribly addicted to my phone and this is helping me massively 🥰",5,2021-01-08 11:14:30
Sam Witt,"I really like Forest, and I'm glad it's free on android. I am weirdly sympathetic to digital plants and animals, so the motivation to stay away from my phone and not kill the plants by exiting the app is strong. I would feel really bad if one died!! Great app interface. Simple and cute, and pleasing for someone like me with aspegers. Edit: oh, please bring back the extended timer feature! I miss being able to set it to 8 hours to keep me from using my phone during the night.",5,2020-11-11 16:40:21

Links from discord to join a room is no longer working for me. :( i have already reinstalled the forest and the discord apps, and also tryed reset app preferences. Neither made a difference.",5,2020-12-16 21:43:55
Anushka Anand,"Brilliant work ""SEEKRTECH"" , it's the best for you too keep yourself focused and away from phone. I've learnt about this app through a video on YouTube. The best part is even if you peek into the app for a while, it won't let you stay there for a longer period and will continuosly motivate and inspire you to do and complete your work. Great work 💯👍",5,2020-11-17 13:16:55
Shahana Bibi,"Love this app! It's good as a free app but it does have restrictions & also doesn't have a lot of tree selection. But the premium version is so worth it! It's not very pricey, I would say ₹180 for this app is a pretty good deal! Love the stats it gives me, helps me be more productive by analysing how much time I spend doing what. Forest is definitely one of my top apps for productivity! Gives what it promises, is simple & has clean interface. Love the friends feature too.",5,2020-11-02 09:16:08
Verlie Myers,"Works for me! I love that it not only keeps me from picking up my phone when I don't need to, it also lets me see how long I've studied/focused/whatever each day. I also love the ambiant noise option! My only complaint is I wish it had a louder alarm when done!",5,2020-11-30 12:29:39
Musical Maggie,"I used to be a study skills tutor, and I commonly recommended this to students who struggled to stay off their phones or needed a focus timer. Forest is visually appealing, motivating, and user friendly. Unlike many other apps of its type, it doesn't induce shame; someone can go back to their phone in an emergency, they just lose the tree. It also allows for easy time tracking, amd for students to play music/spotify throughout the period (so long as they don't adjust). Love this app!",5,2020-11-16 16:36:24
Elizabeth,"Great for focusing and stopping phone addiction. I like that you can unlock lots of different types of trees (motivation) and encouraging messages while you grow trees. Even though there are issues due to the age of my device, the support team is amazing and is trying to fix them. Don't forget to press sync in settings if you get premium (which you should) and use multiple devices. There is also a toggeable Deep Focus Mode to stop you leaving the app and snow in December.",5,2020-12-09 17:58:32
Rifqi Afrizal,"... I like this app so I buy the pro version, I hope the developer can create and update this app not only adding the variety of the tree but also the other aspects. Since the plant ground cannot be changed (green grass and brown soil) and the theme of the app just green I think it's kinda boring to see this all day. I suggest the new update can change the theme app and the plant ground to seasonal or fantasy place. Edit: Thanks for granting my wish, I love it!",5,2020-12-02 09:54:07
Anton Burger,"A good tool for my fellow ADHD comrades! I do suggest you use the pro version and set it on ""Deep Focus"" mode since it contains the functions that guide you back to your forrest when you go onto facebook, whatsapp and other distractions. That is where I really found the benefits of the app. Without those functions, it is too easy to defy the purpose of the app. And the pro function is quite cheap, only ZAR 39.00 (South African rands).",5,2020-11-18 06:01:01
It's me! Kyi Cin,"Forest is really good. Just having someone appreciating you after all the hard works you've done, this is a blessing. I really do recomend you to this app. But one problem. When I set the timer and then when I come to get it,it doesn't give me money sometimes. Please fix this",5,2020-11-26 08:38:52
Nikki Dreeves,"I ADORE this app. It's great for people (like me) who need some incentive to keep working! I'm a college kid, and every time I study, I log it on Forest. When I look over the app and see all of the trees, bushes, and flowers that I planted, it makes me really proud! It's definitely a sense of accomplishment. And the team that made this app are doing amazing things with reforestation! What's not to like??",5,2020-11-12 15:24:52
Sufiyan Shaikh,"Hello everyone, you should download this app definitely, because it will boost up your productivity, as no one want to dry up a tree. You will feel a force acting on you to get back to work. Download it.",5,2020-12-25 03:37:09
rafiq mir,"This app is worthy of being an 'Editor's Choice' ! Before using this app, I was very much addicted to my phone. And due to that, I had eye strains making my eye really red. That redness wouldn't disappear in 1-2 days and the head of my institution told me consequently to have rest at home because they believed I had a pink eye. After two months of gett continual ""sick holidays"" I found this app and voila! My redness vanished. I also get de-addicted and detoxed(digitally). Thankyou Forest :-)",5,2020-10-29 04:53:35
lee s,I was excited about the new tree (twilight gaurdian) event but I studied for 3 hours today and the event didn't log any of it. I would give this app 5 stars if only all the features worked... I have the full paid version and everything up to date EDIT: Woops! my bad... Since the event had popped up on my page I thought it had begun already. Thank you for your quick response. This is a great app for keeping me off my phone while studying,5,2020-12-15 17:54:57
Hydro,"The app is too good , i have the premium version. but i have only one problem . recently i bought a new phone and when i tried to export my data i entered forest app from my old phone then i went to settings - account - (my name) - export your data and i choosed wifi direct to export it ,it succeded but my trees and everyrhing were downloaded as a file that i didnt know how to open or use . pleaaaase help !!",5,2020-10-30 17:55:40
Forgetmenot _16,This app is very useful for me as a student to focus and to get some work done. It costs like 1 or 2 dollars to unlock the full app. (When we waste so much money on other stuff i guess this isn't a much price to pay.) Anyways happiest thing is that I'm able to contribute to a real planting campaign through this app. I highly recommend this app. Very satisfied.,5,2020-12-01 13:37:45
Akhil Chandran,"Ausome concept. Not only for the studies but also we can remember the importance of nature and how valuable are Trees... Just like our time. Nice trick to make one focused and to wipe out laziness. *I'm sad only by the loss of abilities in premium membership*. Expect more apps. I have a suggestion, as by the duration we focus on, can't we increase the length of the tree.... Let it flowered? 🙏I have a request please allow to plant together with my friend. At least a friend 🙏 please...",5,2020-11-18 09:25:53
Ratnesh Aroskar,"It's an nice app and simple to use, those who complaint about premium features, it's an one time payment and not really that expensive. I found this as a great way to get yourself an incentive to curb the smartphone addiction",5,2020-12-16 13:50:41
Diya Kasaragod,Best app for concentrating on your work. Would recomend the premium subscription which helps you add your friends to the list!,5,2021-01-07 17:46:43
bindu thomas,Great way of being productive. I love how you can plant trees while not studying and make your forest look awesome. I downloaded this around a week ago and I already unlocked 3 trees and have more than 30 trees in my forest. This is offline too. It is awesome. I reccomend this to anyone who is preparing for exams or just studying but can't not look at their phone. P. S if you plant a tree for. 2 hrs which is what I do you actually get 4 trees planted. I also love how it's Christmas themed. ❤️❤️,5,2020-12-05 16:31:02
Saee Sakhare,Great app . I just loved it . It really makes me happy when I see my tree planted of forest full of trees . But theme should improve and plese make all those pretty trees free because my mum do not allow me to get pro . Other than its beautiful and much helpful .,5,2020-12-18 15:59:24
Aqeedat Nauman,The best productivity app I have tried It always motivate you to study for example on the first day you planted 5 trees and were focused for 2 hours the next day you want to be focused for more time cause you want to plant more times and also you would not want to wither your tree that why I think so it is the best try If you haven't given it a try yet do try it I am sure you won't regret it I hope my review helps you,5,2021-01-12 07:52:08
Gia,"Absolutely love this app. Just wish the trees were a little cheaper in coins so they were easier to get. At the moment it takes me a month to get a new one. But at least that means I have to stay committed! The app is so cute, would highly recommend to anyone, especially students. Been doing a lot more uni work since I got this!!",5,2020-12-09 00:33:52
Anna Robertson,"Edited: Love this app; discovered the Deep Focus Mode after leaving this review (thanks Seekrtech for your reply). It's a lovely design and once the settings are set it works really well! OG: I don't get how it helps; I've just downloaded it, but as I type this my tree is growing in the background. Ie. I can use other apps at the same time, negating the purpose of this app. The design is just lovely though, and I love the premise, so I hope that the ""glitch"" [I assume] is resolved soon.",5,2020-12-13 12:56:11
Zena Mahmoud,This app is the best I love it so much I keep growing my forest and it stops me from entering other apps to focus which is perfect also if I give up the tree dies which makes me more eager to study so that the tree can grow it also has relaxing music which is great for background noice I really recommend this to the whole world and the best thing is if you upgrade they plant a real tree each time you plant a tree in the app this is the best app I have on my phone and it will always be the best,5,2020-12-22 14:18:46
Gurpreet Singh,"This is awesome, the mechanics of the app are legit, it make working fun, whenever the app is running I get this sense of growing my plant and making a greener forest......... feeling. . . I was a mobile addict and with this app I am able to leave my phone aside and spend time with myself... Thank.",5,2020-11-01 18:56:33
B Turner,I decided to try this app for myself and for my kid. I have trouble both focusing and staying on task due to health reasons & autism and my kid has ADHD and autism This has helped a LOT. My kid started secondary school in Sept & was struggling to focus while doing homework. The app has helped tremendously and instead of it taking 2+ hours with constant reminders from me to focus it is down to less than an hour and I rarely have to remind them they're doing homework. Great app!,5,2020-11-15 20:33:34
Randa Khalid,I love this app but why I can only set 2 hours maximum..... It'll be nice if you added the time to 3 hours focus,5,2021-01-01 08:31:12
Mădălina,the best productivity app I've used so far! it doesn't have distracting functions and I love how I can organise everything using tags. the cherry on top is the incredibly cute design! (the only feature I think it could benefit from would be a pause function for 60+ minute activities),5,2020-12-01 08:19:51
Kak Yull,"[Edit: I can restore after the latest UPDATE 4.26.2] Thank You :). ***** Trouble white noise sound. And the premium users can't restore their purchase. It means, you have to pay again once log out or switch device. The developers even do not care about this. They just money oriented. This is my honest review. So please, DON'T USE THIS APP! You can install Digital Wellbeing by Google LLC as an alternative. It's free but powerful.",5,2020-11-05 11:48:42
Elizabeth Clive,"I love this app. It has helped me so many times when I need to get work done but I can't focus, I just turn on the app and simply removing my distractions from my phone helps so much. They also allow you to donate the credits you earn to planting real trees which I think is really amazing.",5,2020-11-30 07:18:10
Micah Haripersad,"Highly effective app, inspires to work to achieve, gives users a feeling of good achievement with regards to their goals and ambitions. However, I think that users should have more access to features that come with the pro version, without the pro version.",5,2020-11-10 18:03:52
Luke Almendariz,Our mobile devices and technology are only going to get more and more advanced to the point that we can't live without them (barring oxygen). This app understands that. But it trains you to be with your phone without being controlled by it. It shows you that it is possible. This is a skill and habit that we all need as we progress forward as humanity. Amazing concept!,5,2020-11-20 01:48:09
Sujata Arya,It was a very good app as it generates the same feeling as if we are playing a game and we need to purchase different types of trees by staying focused. Its addictive to me. Its a nice approach. Good work developers. Keep it up.,5,2020-11-26 07:56:42

Aqeedat Nauman,The best productivity app I have tried It always motivate you to study for example on the first day you planted 5 trees and were focused for 2 hours the next day you want to be focused for more time cause you want to plant more times and also you would not want to wither your tree that why I think so it is the best try If you haven't given it a try yet do try it I am sure you won't regret it I hope my review helps you,5,2021-01-12 07:52:08

Just Did It Body Transformations,"Rubbish - the app no longer works properly. I've used this to track habits for years and even paid for the premium version. Yesterday it suddenly stopped working. I've emailed customer service with ZERO response. They take your money, then ignore all your emails.",1,2021-01-02 08:07:35
Gemma Draper,"Don't bother with this app. As others have said, widgets no longer work unless you open the app first. The whole point of a widget is that you shouldn't have to do that. Despite using this app every day for most of this year, I'm now uninstalling as it doesn't seem to be supported any more.",1,2021-01-05 17:32:11
Viv,"I've enjoyed the app for a few years, but it has gotten increasingly buggy for me--the widget works intermittently, and all of a sudden one of my habits stopped tracking a streak today, which persisted even after uninstalling and reinstalling.",1,2020-12-30 15:18:58
Marcos Avila,"I've used this app on iPhone before. I had at least 2 years worth of habits tracked. I recently switched to android and tried logging in but it keeps telling me something went wrong and to try again in a bit. I've uninstalled the app several times but it won't change anything. I tried registering a new account and it keeps kicking me back to the first login screen. I can't select the ""forgot password"" option either. I really hope this can be resolved soon.",1,2020-11-20 16:20:46
Huan Lim,"Very bad! Account registration kept failed despite multiple attempts. When I finally succeed after 1 hour, i couldn't log in! Kept showing Internet problem while i could surf smoothly on other device. Obviously there's bugssss but the developer just don't bother, push all to user issues! Don't purchased! Doesn't worth your time and money. Frustrating! 😡😠",1,2020-11-20 15:33:09
Arko Bhattacharyya,The app is not valued your past data records rather they are eager to earn money. I've been using since one and half year. After my phone's reseting due to a custom software update I'd installed this app again and tried to log in to sycn my data but it displayed you've no account against your email Id. After several time I used to log in with my user name and then they displayed to purchase premium subscription to access previous saved data.This is my first time bitter experience with them.,1,2020-12-04 10:06:28
Elizabeth Coburn,"** Uninstalled and reinstalled and still can't open.** Happy to see app has been updated & can once again sync progress.

Oleg Naumov,It's laggy and buggy as hell. 1) u need to resize widget to check 2) widget shows only top 4 habits. I am so tired of it. Totally not worth its money as nobody fixes these bugs for almost half a year! I paid 10 bucks for just a WIDGET and it doesn't work. This is totally frustrating,1,2020-11-13 07:22:02
Thunder bolt0o7,Worst app ever I used. I had purchased subscription and uninstalled from phone and after again installing and login it is showing password is wrong . While doing forget password it is showing your email is not registered with our data base . What the hell is going developer? Kindly reply otherwise I will take a disciplinary action against this app. Hope you will reply ASAP. Thanks for a worst app,1,2020-11-23 17:27:46

Alex Swift,"Started off OK but now no notifications work at all which is kind of key. I don't like that you can't pause a habit (you can deactivate but that doesn't feel right) and if you want it to work properly, you need to pay the random amount charged that day/week/month but I wouldn't advise it as the devs never respond on any platform and their forum shows loads of dissatisfied buyers. There's actually a decent app in here somewhere but no notifications and no support = 1*.",1,2021-01-07 23:40:55
Vasileios Topouzis,I paid back in the day for premium when the app was called 'Habit bull' yet when I try to log in it says my email is not in the database...

Alek,"Notification Bar is to small. The notification that I receive after setting up everything (including but not limited to alarm sounds) is very small - just a 0.01x0.01 png image of a bull and the app defaut alarm sound - but there is not any visual effects [I have the volume turned up, and I went into the system settings to make sure that the app sound overrides the system to pop up on the screen] and I was wanting the display to illuminate over the whole screen and/or open the app up.",1,2020-08-28 18:21:39

Matt Wall,"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.",1,2020-03-05 08:01:30
Dirk M,"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking.""",1,2020-02-06 03:52:22
J H,The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.,1,2019-12-04 08:02:56

Very upset and disappointed.",1,2020-02-11 12:00:11
Ahmet Engin Ural,"Unrecoverably crashed, reinstalled. Then the data partially gone. Pretty disappointed.

Also there have been no update, and no responses to the roughly 75 - 100 error logs that I have submitted. I paid $5.00 (US) for a ""life time subscription"" to the premium version.

Michael Szubrowski,This app would be great if they would just stop locking people out of premium. This has happened with several users for months and still not fixed.

Akshay Aradhya,"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost.

G C,Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back.

Paolo Moretti,"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue).

Sai Prakash,Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.,1,2020-06-13 16:08:36

Sai Prakash,Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application.

I was surprised to learn I needed to pay a subscription for widget control, however I was okay with that since it offered what I was looking for. Sadly the widget barely works. Trying to tap the widget typically does nothing, so then I need to delete the widget and re-add in order to get it working properly.

And if you do end up choosing this, I wouldn't rely too much on the log in to save my data.

Taiwo Reuben,I am not happy. I paid for the premium app without the ads so that I could have more than 5 habits. Then I end up breaking my phone so I had to replace it. When I reinstalled the app I lost my premium status which I paid for. I emailed Habitbull requesting they restore my status because I already paid for the premium version. I even attachrd a copy of my receipt to the email to prove I paid for the permium version. No response. I contacted them months ago. Nothing. I do not recommend this app.,2,2020-11-18 05:32:05

After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful.

Matt M,"I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.",2,2019-09-17 03:08:01

I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,2,2019-11-10 07:41:38

It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg.

Håvard Andersen,"It's misleading to list data export as a reason to buy Premium, when it is not included with Premium. It would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system. Additionally, the Platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33% off. The greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33% off price.

Kyle Smith,"This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.",2,2019-05-19 20:30:07

Damon Chang,DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,2,2019-11-10 07:41:38

The app lacks the polish off others available for less and feels more like a beta than a final product. In the end, I found a better app that's completely free, has more features, and a cleaner UI. My advice to the developer is to ditch the subscription model (or make it less expensive and annual).",3,2020-09-14 10:51:16

Rusty Shackleford,"It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",3,2018-12-13 19:40:16

The app lacks the polish off others available for less and feels more like a beta than a final product. In the end, I found a better app that's completely free, has more features, and a cleaner UI.

R Lavender,it’s a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ”multiple times a day” So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?,3,2019-06-20 21:31:07
Senthilkumar S Kathiresan,I bought the paid verison. It does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers. But habits aren't as simple as it is... we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time. If I want to develop a habit of waking up by 7.. it shouldn't be a yes or no question... I should be able to enter the time track it over the month.,3,2019-06-20 13:50:59

Kristin Star Picun,"The one major short-coming of this app. (and most other ""habit trackers"") is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number (amount of hours, etc.) for a week or month--only a number of days or per day...That is a gaping deficit in these app's (with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats), as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from.day to day. The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service, as I e-mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade (because it is a really helpful/useful application), and never got any response in about a year's time. :-\ Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above--which I really hope they'll address/include that capability, it is a really helpful and useful app., and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ""OCD"" who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self-care and/or productivity (though, it could, also have the opposite effect, if people with ""OCD"" get too immersed in tracking things in their day-to-day :-S). In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*",4,2019-09-07 01:55:35

Hoping to use this app every day!",4,2019-06-02 13:35:16
Karmen P,"This is by far my favorite habit tracking app (and I've tried many). I like the weekly view. (I have an unusual use for this app.....I use it to track my kids' school work and I like the weekly view so I can see what they have completed during the week). However, I'm not sure if this app is still being supported? The last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries. But the app does still work well.",4,2019-11-14 19:30:50
Rod Goree,"Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit. As I am frequently adding habits, I would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them. Hopefully, this is an easy fix. Then this will be a 5-star app.",4,2020-02-18 17:33:24
Leah Yegneswaran,"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.",4,2020-06-04 05:19:54
Cloe St-Jean,"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off",4,2020-07-17 18:36:43
Pauly Gillespie,"Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended. Only concern is I'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue I have (not sure it's real yet, but if it is I'm concerned). Otherwise five stars.",4,2019-12-28 18:30:57
Brandon Woltz,"This app is great, closest I've found to what I want! But I wish there was an option to add ""goals"" instead of just ""habits"" and give the goals a bit more options for their completion and reminders. Sure, I want to have the habit of eating healthy lunches, but I also want to record my goal of losing a certain amount of weight over a few months. :)",4,2019-11-07 18:04:08
Nikoleta Bertová,"Great app, easy to use, nice design, motivating statistics and quotes. Thank you developers for this app :). Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period). Maybe there could be an option to apply this change only to further period (e.g. when I start an activity twice a week, it becomes a habit and I want to increase it to 3 times a week and I don't want to lose/worsen previous statistics).",4,2019-02-05 21:03:38
Brittany Dibble,Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.,4,2019-05-09 14:40:33
Joshua Kölzer,"Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?",4,2019-09-18 13:41:40
Spartan 117 Bat,"Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version.",4,2020-05-30 05:12:42
Josh K,"the app has helped me track my habits and create new better habbits. i have been 7 weeks drinking nothing but water and have been on and off with candy and snacks. just like any other habit tracking app, this will not do the work for you. it is here to hell you keep track of the work you are putting forth, and it does a good job at that.",4,2019-05-29 14:24:22
No Nonsense,"Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app.",4,2020-05-20 02:48:42
Jayden Young,"The widgets look great, and i like the idea behind this app, but it feels like im fighting it to create goals where i would have to start over completely to make it a single task vs a quantity. also my biggest issue is that you cant set a quantity per week, only per day. i want to be able to set x number of hours per week doing a task without any daily requirements",4,2018-11-06 21:03:57
Aislin Percival,"This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it.",4,2019-10-03 13:08:18
Lindsey Crawford,"Habitbull is great. I love how customizable it is for making different types of habits. Tracking my current streak is great for motivating me to keep on going. And even if I break my streak, I love that it shows my ""best score"" so I have a new goal to reach. The only thing I would suggest is having a ""user suggestions"" button in the settings. I have emailed about a new type of habit a couple times and have never heard anything back. User feedback is always good for making a great app even better",4,2019-01-22 04:15:59
Kelly Dennis,"Newly installed re: resolutions. Seems to be a bug on Android when I set a target date it sets it to the day after. If I go back in and change it back one day, it keeps it. Please fix.

darude sandstorm,"its a good app, the cool thing for me is that you can comment per day, so if you fail with your habits you can find out what things stand in your way, i withdraw one star because i want to make a feature request: when you select ""all habits "" i also want to see all comments (mixed) this way the app would also be a holistic diary , thx :-)",4,2019-01-21 11:15:03
Yuka and Kuma,"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable.",4,2019-10-18 04:59:53
Axi Kristine,"I love this app and the widgets are awesome. 1 star lost because I am frequently getting pop ups (about 5 a day) stating it stopped and to restart app. And there is no update available. I might uninstall if this continues and it gets on my nerves. For now, works for what I need it for.",4,2018-09-15 06:37:57
Witte van der Tempel,"Love it! Would like to see a few more details in the graphs. It would be handy if you could scroll through the weeks smoothly instead of one week at a time. The dark version of the app should be the standard imo, it looks cooler ánd it saves power! I'd love to have a timer as an option to measure the amount of time spent on a habit. Thinking of meditation, breathing exercises.",4,2019-10-12 08:30:13
Matthew Woods,"This app seems to work pretty well. The user forums aren't well managed, but remain useful. Habit Tracker has never crashed on me, but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the UI has focus at the time you launch the app. Fortunately its easy to navigate.",4,2020-02-11 13:38:49
A Google user,"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.",4,2019-01-29 07:43:59
Vicki Esche,"It's a good app. I like the encouraging reminders and memes each day. I wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking, but overall it's good. It doesn't eat my battery like the last one I tried. In fact. I'm readjusting to use in the coming year.",4,2019-12-29 03:26:24
Miroslav Kovar,"Pretty good at what it does, exactly what I needed. However, there is a small bug - weekly review widget does not show all my habits. Moreover, I miss a feature to periodically share my weekly/monthly reviews on social media, or with at least with someone. Accountability helps.",4,2018-10-14 11:07:07
Nathaniel Barratt,"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks.",4,2020-05-25 11:05:54
Santi Czaban,"A great app overall. Complete and specific in terms of types of goals. User interface aspects like fonts and some screens like the first ""create habit"" screen seem a little heterogeneous when compared to the rest of the app; in other words, they seem displaced, out of vibe. I suggest a review of the UI; maybe making it a little less cluttery and cleaner. For example, the google fit prompts and font correlation. It is a great work nevertheless, congratulations!",4,2019-05-22 19:52:17
Emily D,The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.,4,2019-10-11 22:45:33
Stefan Cohen,"A good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life. Limited flexibility, in the free version, but sufficient four basic tracking of self-improvement efforts. Easy to get started. And so I can do without cute reminder and encouragement features, they are easy enough to toggle off.",4,2020-02-16 15:28:37
Luke,I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,4,2020-05-06 03:51:28
Ludwig Van Deventer,"Great app. My only problem is some of my habits I created doesn't work; I set a habit so I don't do something atleast 8 days of the month, but it links all the days inbetween successful days together. I only end up being successful for 6 days out of the month, but then it says 20+ days successful, because it link all the successful days together. Going to try other apps, unless I can resolve this issue.",4,2019-04-13 14:01:23
Tye Lucio,It's very simple to use. I like that you can set as either a yes/no habit or a rep like two times a day. My only hangup would be that the free version only allows tracking for five habits but that can be a bonus if your just getting started. You don't want to overwhelm yourself.,4,2019-05-27 16:59:17
Michael Brown,"Really good way of tracking habits and progress (exercise and quality of baby's sleep are my uses). Only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front (even if only in the premium version perhaps). I'd like to see something like a target for average number instead of pass/fail, that'd provide an extra way of approaching habits I think. I'm picking at hairs though, it's a very good app, that does the job it advertises.",4,2020-06-03 07:52:33
Kimberly and Zachary White,"really effective app. best widget of all the habit tracking apps I've tried. But the widget can be a little glitchy and I wish there were a compact version. some of the UX leaves a little to be desired. I'd love to see some small improvements espec to widgets, but still definitely worth using. premium paid user.",4,2019-03-11 19:17:16
daniels rose,"So far, so good. I love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day, rather than just once a day. This has definitely helped me develop a routine. I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that.",4,2018-11-02 19:40:54
Christopher Pangilinan,"I've had this for about 6 months now and tbh its helped me out. you're allowed 5 free habits. any more than that you have to pay but i think 5 is a great start because you dont want to bombard yourself with too many changes. its simple, easy to use...it takes awhile to form habits so be patient and honest with your entries. it'll help you see where you're failing and succeeding by %. i noticed i did habits because i didnt want to fail. now i notice i perform habits because i want to excel.",4,2019-04-22 18:43:28
Bwalya Chanda,"this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though",4,2020-04-06 10:01:44
A Google user,I just downloaded it to see the continuity of work I do. I found it personally useful. 1st : I am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit. which I wanted to continue. 2nd : Now I can read the comments I entered after finishing the tasks. Now it is becoming habit for me to keep track on my habits that i see improvement in overall doing. i hope i still achieve lot more through this app. I heartly thank to the developers and creators of this app. signing off.,4,2019-02-21 04:10:03
Tara Valdez,"I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",4,2020-04-30 03:42:56
Clinton Lough,great habit tracking app and you get plenty without premium. I like the premium widgets quite a bit and the extra habits. Would be better if it had the option to flag a habit as skipped rather than fail without breaking the chain for when you can't do it. E.g. In bed early when you have to stay back late at work.,4,2019-06-20 21:15:16
Amber Lombard,Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.,4,2019-04-06 21:35:09
Simon Nilsson,Great app for succeeding with your good habits. The widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits. I also like the discussion page but I miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post/comment was posted. Sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it.,4,2019-11-11 10:20:48
Carolyn Allen,i suggest a positive running tab amd also a negative running tab! i love the app and it really makes a difference in tracking my daily habits. the only thing i have found that would make it better is if i could track relapses. this would require it to allow something that i do NOT want to mark for a day amd when it is marked then it would be a negative. this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse. i would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks.,4,2019-04-28 15:40:36

For example, if I set a goal to drink 60 ounces of water a day for 2 months, but I later want to change it to 80 ounces a day, I either update the goal (which changes any previous days less than 80 to failures), or start a new goal which forfeits the streak.",4,2021-01-05 17:42:53

Vikas Gupta,Application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing - Duplicate Task feature doesn't duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated Tasks. So you cannot create a Template Task which could be used to create other similar deep Task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures. This is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently. Without this i will be forced to look at less,1,2021-01-09 19:41:51

Gabriel Ingram,"This app is incredibly unintuitive. Attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated. I still can't get the ""specific dates"" option to function properly in the calendar. The app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics. This should not have left beta with so many duplication errors. Please fix this. I regret paying for this app. Edit: Additionally, deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in it's place.",3,2020-09-14 07:52:49
Spencer Ferri,"I gave this 3 stars. I do like this app and it has lots of potential. But I think in execution a few different arrangements would make it more useful. For example, if the default mode was to instantiate a particular task from a class of universal tasks, it would be easier and simpler than managing a list of variables under which tasks are contained. Characteristics could have sub-characteristics as well. Items could have more well-defined powers like delegating the task but not completing it.",3,2020-09-14 12:09:00
Nathan Peirce,"This seems like a great app, but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation, with dozens of daily tasks, then there's no realistic way to recover, because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of pass/fails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today. Multi-select helps, but still no good after a summer break, or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year = 4380 to dismiss by tapping each one. Could solve with a ""Select All"" feature.",3,2020-08-25 18:45:32

Jeff Moore,"I really like the depth of this tracker, including skills, titles, really more of an Elder Scrolls feel, and personally, seeing myself being lacking in certain skills would motivate me to add more tasks that would improve those. I was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve, all of the tasks and their various skills, and really dig into the advanced features, but then I hit the deal breaker. There is no web interface for this app. Everything has to be set up on your phone. I love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks, habits, and to-dos on the go, but I'm looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially, and continue adding and modifying as time goes on, but to have to do that on my Note 20+ is just something I'm not on board with. I need to be able to pull it up on my computer as I'm working to check things off, or see my next scheduled task. By picking up my phone being the only way to check what I need to do, it sets me up for failure, because my phone is a distraction I'm trying to use less while working. And since I'm working from home now, there's no accountability, so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong. If there was a way to open this on a browser (and not through some janky android emulator, or using my chromebook, because I don't use that for work) then I'd already be neck deep in it, but sadly I'm stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar, something I couldn't care less about. Please get a browser interface going!!",3,2020-10-15 14:40:04
Amanda Ison,"I really enjoyed the concept, used it for about a year and paid. What ultimately stopped me from using it is it is not user friendly and glitched constantly. It wouldn't keep my settings even though I changed the default. Or populate tasks on my widget.

Just an idea id be up for.",3,2019-09-27 05:33:44
Michael Bruce Allen,"This app could be five stars to me. what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do. There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row.",3,2020-01-14 14:02:49

Gustavo Bustos Soto,"I really like the app, but I would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in LifeRPG.

CA C,"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)",3,2019-07-07 16:42:31
Christopher Kinnaird,"It's not bad. But it seems greedy. Like, why do I have to pay to unlock individual color themes if I'm paying a monthly subscription? Also, LifeRPG was so much better than this. More icons to choose from and they were free. If you're going to make an app that copies all the ideas from LifeRPG, at least make it better.

Chantelle v.d. Vyver,"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks. Actually marking something as done, especially subtasks is a challenge - mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there. Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier.",3,2019-08-13 20:29:08
Daniel Whited,"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",3,2020-03-17 03:00:21

Anyway, I will definitely retry after an update :)",3,2019-05-19 22:41:42
Russ Irvine,"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",3,2020-03-28 09:18:40
BriantBB,"This app is pretty cool and I'm trying to get used to be but geez its so difficult to just create the list of repeatable tasks I want to have.

an Mori,"The presentation is slick, highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to ""just do one more thing before bed time"". Liking it!

belu irina,Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,3,2020-04-02 22:56:31
Martin Haryanto,The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily.

Danzigx,"Nice idea with a few issues: some tasks never seem to go away. Whether I say I did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day.

Jason Bourn,"Don't like it very much, but I think it's just not for me. It's very complex and deep with tasks and such (I could even set the percentage of fear for a task... What??) so I didn't get very far before I just said ""forget it"". My life is too busy for such complexity.",3,2018-08-28 11:44:57

Sweet NP,"I really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks. But a while ago whenever I would open the app, it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if I tapped anything. The rest of my phone still works fine (doesn't freeze) while this happens. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I would love to continue using this app. Thank you! (And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.) Edit: Clearing did solve the problem for now. Too bad I had to give up all the progress I made. But thank you anyway, at least I can use the app again.",3,2018-04-02 07:33:37
-Crispy- -Boi-,"Loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so I'm not using it anymore. I'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time.

Mehmet Sakarya,"I thought it was a really good app until today. It started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup. I lost all of my options, to-do lists,  achievements. Don't know what should i do, really disappointed. Auto back-up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files(not dropbox)",3,2018-03-18 17:59:03

wood land Nut,Great app. Needs  a few things like task fail without consequences option. Mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase. Not every one has everything connected to Internet all the time.,3,2017-10-12 20:53:45
Devon Jones,It's such a spectacular idea but I had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day-to-day basis.,3,2017-09-19 21:15:10
J Skud,"Everything about this app is perfect! Except for the widget support. The widget doesn't update with the new tasks I make in the app. And I wish I could mark tasks as complete right from the widget. I would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task, or set one task to repeat multiple times a day. I also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time. Great start",3,2017-08-17 02:51:37
Isa Egizbay,"Hey, guys! This is good idea! However, I have a feedback for you: Several times I accidentally was clicking task more than once, so I was increasing my level. I didn't found related settings. I think you should make task clickable (checkable, do you get me?) )only once per day, and highlight the finished tasks. This features will prevent accidental checking, therefore increasing level incorrectly. Could you explain me how to use such features, if you already have them??",3,2017-08-15 15:06:09

A Google user,"This is unforgivably close to perfect. Why no timer? So many tasks are long-term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit.

DeeKat,"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!",3,2016-12-07 12:10:43

Najwa HADDAR,"Its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you? E.g. i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41. I will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg, completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc.  Otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me. Really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100.",3,2016-08-25 21:47:19

Kyle McArthur,Cool idea. I like the depth. There's potential here. But it's a pain to setup and fiddle with and the subtasks don't repeat properly making it functionally worthless for me.,3,2021-01-09 09:26:19
Faustin Del Testa,This provided everything i was expecting i was giving it a try and planing to buy the premium version so i could use all the feature. But this is so STUPIDLY expensive that i wasnt able to go on using it knowing that ill never have the full experience. I know devs gotta be paid but i dont want to use a subscription. Anf 50~ € for a phone app is litterally ridiculous.,3,2021-01-08 12:47:49
Nona de Plume,I really like this app. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's rather laborious to set up the tasks you want to include. I found it rather overwhelming.,3,2020-12-16 18:34:47
Morgan Richardson,"Hard to use. Great concept, just hard to use. The language used in the making tasks interface doesn't make any sense. Trying to delete premade tasks is not easy, if possible. But I do love the concept and the graphics.",3,2020-12-16 04:37:47
Bacchatus Desiderium,"Good idea. A little clunky in execution. It used to crash when I tried to update the avatar. Now it crashes when trying to view a skill. New update, new crash. Wish it worked for me, but I'll be looking for an alternative.",3,2020-11-27 01:52:02
Jamie McLachlan,"I love the idea of this app though I would love to be able to schedule a due date for the future and it is not allowing me to do that so everything on my to do list ends up being ""late"" because I like to put many tasks on the night before.",3,2020-11-19 17:41:26
Katze Ja,"I used to love this app, but they decided to make one of the most important (in my opinion) features exclusive to premium. This wouldn't normally be a big deal, but premium is a subscription or 46 dollars. I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks one time for this feature, but why would I subscribe just to use a feature that used to be free? I would be willing to pay a small fee if I can just get this feature back. (Even though it amazes me that they took it away.)",3,2020-11-14 02:20:17
DrugRug Slayden,"Great great great idea it's actually awesome to have an app like this. Unfortunately it's not what I was looking for, I wanted to set my own daily reminders that I am obligated to do like feed my dog on time and workout on time.

Summer,"I have been trying out this app for a few days now. I like creating the game but the update has made it harder to do. I can't have start and end days without paying anymore- and I have multi-day homework assignments! (I am in high school.) Apparently this is a subscription service? I might check elsewhere for another, more free game with this concept...which means I lose my disco Squirrel I just bought :(",3,2020-11-11 19:01:15

Kinkade Minson,"Almost perfect... I only wish it had more to do with the ""game"" aspect. It's basically a to-do list or planner. Sure, it gives you some ""gold"" and experience points based on your completed tasks, but they amount to nothing, as there is nothing to do with either once collected. No built-in items to purchase, no character creation or customisation... disappointing. That being said, the tasks are easy to create and customise. I feel more organised than usual. So, thanks, I guess.",3,2020-10-27 13:15:29
Jeff Moore,"I really like the depth of this tracker, including skills, titles, really more of an Elder Scrolls feel, and personally, seeing myself being lacking in certain skills would motivate me to add more tasks that would improve those. I was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve, all of the tasks and their various skills, and really dig into the advanced features, but then I hit the deal breaker. There is no web interface for this app. Everything has to be set up on your phone. I love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks, habits, and to-dos on the go, but I'm looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially, and continue adding and modifying as time goes on, but to have to do that on my Note 20+ is just something I'm not on board with. I need to be able to pull it up on my computer as I'm working to check things off, or see my next scheduled task. By picking up my phone being the only way to check what I need to do, it sets me up for failure, because my phone is a distraction I'm trying to use less while working. And since I'm working from home now, there's no accountability, so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong. If there was a way to open this on a browser (and not through some janky android emulator, or using my chromebook, because I don't use that for work) then I'd already be neck deep in it, but sadly I'm stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar, something I couldn't care less about. Please get a browser interface going!!",3,2020-10-15 14:40:04

Spencer Ferri,"I gave this 3 stars. I do like this app and it has lots of potential. But I think in execution a few different arrangements would make it more useful. For example, if the default mode was to instantiate a particular task from a class of universal tasks, it would be easier and simpler than managing a list of variables under which tasks are contained. Characteristics could have sub-characteristics as well. Items could have more well-defined powers like delegating the task but not completing it.",3,2020-09-14 12:09:00
Gabriel Ingram,"This app is incredibly unintuitive. Attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated. I still can't get the ""specific dates"" option to function properly in the calendar. The app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics. This should not have left beta with so many duplication errors. Please fix this. I regret paying for this app. Edit: Additionally, deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in it's place.",3,2020-09-14 07:52:49

I like customizing, so at first I deleted all presets to replace them with my own, but if I delete all characteristics and then try to add 1 new characteristic the app crashes and the only way to get it to work again is to clear all the data and start the app from scratch.",3,2020-08-30 12:01:29
Nathan Peirce,"This seems like a great app, but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation, with dozens of daily tasks, then there's no realistic way to recover, because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of pass/fails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today. Multi-select helps, but still no good after a summer break, or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year = 4380 to dismiss by tapping each one. Could solve with a ""Select All"" feature.",3,2020-08-25 18:45:32

Amanda Ison,"I really enjoyed the concept, used it for about a year and paid. What ultimately stopped me from using it is it is not user friendly and glitched constantly. It wouldn't keep my settings even though I changed the default. Or populate tasks on my widget. Format for setting up recurring events is hard to navigate and it kept duplicating and deleting tasks when using desktop version. Basically an awesome concept performed poorly. I think if more resources were put in to this app it would be epic!",3,2020-07-24 16:04:11

belu irina,Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,3,2020-04-02 22:56:31

Russ Irvine,"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",3,2020-03-28 09:18:40
Daniel Whited,"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",3,2020-03-17 03:00:21

Ashichuu chu,"Was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day, everyday. Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task.

Martin Haryanto,The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests. For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered. would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,3,2019-11-17 11:00:17

HoppyTimes,"I went from touching the app once a day to once a week, over the span of about 2 months. Would be better if notifications were functional/ could be enabled. I like the concept of being a hero, though.

The notifications aren't working on my phone, and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day, I'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird ""give me a notification 12 hours before"" The whole point of me getting a to-do list app was to have not only a list, but reminders, so until the notifications work I'll have to resort to a different app.",3,2019-10-19 17:28:33
Derek Sparks,Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.,3,2019-10-18 07:56:46

STRELOK Flippy,"It would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest, and even recommend books, etc. Also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are, and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow (for example, read book requires a picture of a book with your face, or run requires a tracking through the GPS to actually verify yoy ran) in this way it can even be competitive",3,2019-08-26 05:55:32

Vassilis Kanavos,"Very interesting concept but it's extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need.

CA C,"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much.

A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!",4,2020-02-26 12:34:08
Laura Arsenyan,"I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?",4,2019-10-27 22:20:30
Johannas Gutenberg,"Personally, taking the time to translate my every task into RPG format is tedious. Pretty time consuming in terms of customization. It's more like an RPG Maker, but to-do style. It's not what I'm looking for but given the developers perspective it's excellent for what it's worth. Flexible, extremely customizable and full of possibilities. Suggestion: allowing to download other users formats they've already taken the time to create.",4,2020-05-08 10:12:31
Bunny Overlord,"app has improved a lot since initial launch and it's still my go-to for my daily tasks! still hoping for more social features in the future. also, there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use, i think it's still related to the amount of tasks i have (i have a very busy schedule), and it causes my phone to overheat. keep up the good work!",4,2020-05-16 15:52:47
Marcin H,"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",4,2020-02-06 06:39:28
Neilia Adolph,"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good !

Edward M.,"It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",4,2019-02-14 03:39:48
Tina Burton,"I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.",4,2019-11-23 02:12:01
Adam Heiderich,"I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!",4,2020-05-12 14:34:33
Herbert Moik,"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.",4,2020-06-29 18:59:40
Philip Banks,"Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars? It's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again.",4,2019-02-04 00:51:07
Motchi Leuterio,"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue.

Manasa D,"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.",4,2019-10-02 06:23:41
Sumire Akonite,"I have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far, definitely worth a subscription for the full experience. Shared it with friends but unfortunately it's only available on Android. One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it. Also, wish it had a web page version like Habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their OS.",4,2020-06-09 22:45:08
steven stonie,Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,4,2019-11-06 18:21:40

Jessica Thang,"A very good rip-off of LifeRPG—taking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly. Seems to be monetizing the idea though, putting in ads and lots of in-app purchases and requiring a RECURRING payment subscription rather than one-time purchase to unlock features",4,2018-12-03 02:54:54
Tony Lashbrook,Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,4,2019-06-13 03:24:48
J V,"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",4,2019-11-20 17:43:44
Skepti,"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.",4,2020-06-16 09:06:31
Zac Jones,"I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task.

Joven Casiano,"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing.

Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",4,2020-02-13 00:25:59
Mike P,"This app is almost everything I want. I just wish there was more of an RPG element. I played Habitica and it didn't quite scratch that itch either.

Muhamad Atarigsyah,"Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.",4,2018-10-26 07:26:44
Kyle Letourneau,I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless.

Mitch Reed,"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",4,2019-06-12 21:20:57
A Google user,Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab.

CyberFr33k,So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added.

Rabbit Moreno,"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!",4,2020-04-02 13:35:11
Max van Andel,"The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work",4,2020-02-17 11:24:08
Ruben Pouw,"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list.

Nick Pazdan,This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,4,2019-08-21 12:17:33

Now i want to add some tasks which when ""Done"" for eg smoking etc, will impact your character in negative way",4,2020-11-22 08:22:36
Kooolkid65,"Was amazing until the most recent update, which took away the duration feature for the free version. Now it's only available on premium. I can still use the app as a task list without due dates (and it still works great, hence 4 stars), but I'd really like to use it for my school tasks, which I'll now have to use a different app to implement due dates on. Still a great app, I'll just have to use it differently now that the feature is gone",4,2020-11-22 04:55:50
Cassie Murphy,"Loving this app, and got my kids to use it too. Only reason it dose not get 5 stars is because I can't set a task for a certain weekday in a month, for example the last Wednesday of every month.",4,2020-11-21 15:05:05
Wesley Cats,"It would also be really nice to see the automatic refresh actually work (google acc) between 2 connected devices. If not possible, a manual refresh button would be sufficient, but proper refreshing would be required in my opinion! Again, love the app!",4,2020-11-12 14:28:13
Lycheese,"Fun app to use, very customisable with the skills, just like any RPG game. I would use it a lot more if we could actually countdown the time as we are performing a task, but the app is already packed with things to do. Support team is very quick in responding too!",4,2020-11-09 06:05:38
Antonio Renecle,"Great, but it is missing a feature that honestly has me looking elsewhere. This app would be perfect for me, except that it seems that the app only provides a ""Successful executions"" graph for a given event with a time interval of _one_ week. I'm interested in the tracking of my successful executions of an event over a long period of time, and so not having an option for a graph over a longer timeline is a bit of a bummer.",4,2020-10-30 19:55:57
Ruben Kelevra,"Rewards: I've seen some complaints here, that you have to come up with something yourself. I've added everything I usually snack between the regular meals and have to earn them now. The amount of gold is reflecting how healthy it is. So fruits are pretty cheap while stuff with refined sugar is quite expensive. Works fine for me 😁",4,2020-10-29 09:58:28
Laila Brozowski,"It really helps with getting things done! Receiving XP, gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do. I like that - on the contrary to other apps - it is actually useful without having to get the premium version. Though the premium version is a nice addition. Suggestion: some rewards could already be existent so you don't have to come up with them yourself. I personally don't have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don't know what gold price would be appropriate.",4,2020-10-25 12:06:41

M W,"Nice app with lot of options. Like the reward system. Developper look active as i read the reviews and take comment into consideration. What is fear doing in the task don t really understand. ? Ui could get some work. Not possible to have reminder on ad vitam eternam task. Don t know if possible to have multiple reminder for the same task but would be usefull Maybe a better tutorial, don t like wall of text for tutorial, something more interactive would be nice. Would love to have reward separated per group, for example i am eating healty all week long i can have a burger. I am stopping smoking + do sport i can have a new phone What would motivated me is a picture of my reward that get slowly fullfilled as I get closer to my goal Very expensive app.",4,2020-10-08 21:31:25
elbastardo77,"Just staryed using it.

Roxi Cato,"So far, just setting it up is very easy...for me. The gaming aspect of it is very appealing for the ADHD side of me. I wish I could get the full version but that will have to wait until I get a job. Thank you so much for creating this app.",4,2020-09-15 04:27:04

Brendan Torres,I like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience. Skill tree. I would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills. Linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge. Some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable. It really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app.,4,2020-08-30 18:47:25

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is simple.. So much more room for work and improvement in all directions! Keep up the great work! My personal request is a bit of work on the inventory system, as it would be great to keep track of that too.

Recommendation : you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills I made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures, maybe like dice roll mechanics. Would be fun to see your skill in use, cos just building them up isn't enough. Good job, add this quest system and its a complete app. Also app generated loot too...",4,2020-07-27 10:43:06
Phil Charbonneau,"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps",4,2020-07-21 02:52:49
Zac Jones,"I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task.

Herbert Moik,"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.",4,2020-06-29 18:59:40

Mike P,"This app is almost everything I want. I just wish there was more of an RPG element. I played Habitica and it didn't quite scratch that itch either.

Adam Heiderich,"I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good.

Marcin H,"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night.

Senti Hetep,"In the few days I've downloaded this app my habit consistency improved 10 fold! Other apps don't give any incentive to get what's on your to do list done beside your own will power; which isn't a bad thing but the extra kick from the stats, the coins and the rewards you can redeem with them, and the achievements help. I also love how customizable the app is, for me at least being able to create your own rewards and achievements makes the app fit me personally.",5,2020-12-27 23:07:30

Kyndred Raven,Amazing app with excellent customer support! This has taken so much stress off my shoulders. Just being able to track the thousand things I'm constantly juggling in my head is a huge help! The system is easy to navigate and highly customizable. Reward system is awesome! Great job! Please continue to optimize this and I will continue to sub :),5,2020-12-24 16:35:57
Febbie Grace,"Have only been using it for 3 days but so far really enjoying it. I can feel the dopamine rush everytime I Finish something. For rewards, I included some ""vices"" I want to cut back on, as well as things that will help me expand more (ie Premium membership for Do It Now 😉) so it also helps me to develop more awareness with my choices knowing I only have limited resources.",5,2020-12-22 04:33:50
Lepore dotCloud,"I've only been using this app for a few days but it's been improving my life already. I am so excited to see the progress in my life 90 days from now. You can gamify the daily tasks you need or want to get done, create rewards, and start leveling yourself up. I watched a great video on YouTube about the concepts of gamification before I got started editing my setup and I continue to add tasks and rewards as inspiration strikes. Good luck on your quest!",5,2020-12-26 18:35:41
Will Pepp,"So it takes a bit of time to set up, if you want to turn your tasks into xp gaining rewards. But once you get the hang of it, it's absolutely fantastic. Highly motivational, not too complicated (after that initial set up) and makes stuff you don't want to do feel worth doing. I recommend the premium for the choice to personalise the character levelling system, as well as a multitude of icons that give it colour, but the base app is still better than others I've tried of the same style.",5,2020-12-11 09:39:51
Michael Harrison,"The best of all I have tried. Very friendly to including friends and multiple ways to get gentle, positive feedback from your efforts. Even though the language concerning the ""Hero"" avatar is decidedly male, the program is easily configurable for all gender combinations. This is the only version I found that allows a personal configuration of EVERY aspect of the engine so it can be as simple or as complex as I wish. One part I really love is the ability to create goals that YOU create.",5,2020-12-09 20:04:07
Michael Parent,"This is by far my favorite ""RPG your life"" Task app. With multiple ways to track your goals, tons of customization options, you can reproduce character sheets from any game you want and create your own personal template from there with custom skills and characteristics that will increase or decrease as you complete goals! The dev updates the app quite frequently and is active on reddit, looking for suggestions and providing help! Great app, been subscribed to it for a while now!",5,2020-12-02 00:46:30
Neil Mecham,"This app is very customizable, which I definitely wanted in an RPG style To Do list. However, it does come at a cost, since getting everything set up how you'd like takes much longer than similar apps. Personally I think the trade is worth it (hence my rating), but be aware that if you're looking for something more simple, this probably isnt the app for you. If you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work, pick this one over the others!",5,2020-10-26 17:23:33
Banshee ㄣ⃒,"A little grind to set it up but it keeps me motivated when I'm in my depressive ruts, because it gives me a sense of accomplishment which in turn motivates me.🙅‍♂️It's truly a smart algorithm, it gives you brain feel good chemicals for doing mundane things that you may have trouble doing even though its easy and quick. Its very detailed so its fully customizable, and you can just tell that this app is from pure passion I love this app, but I'd like to reiterate the slow setup will take awhile.",5,2020-11-17 05:36:56
Sipos Istvan,"I have been using it for years. I do believe I have written multiple reviews with previous accounts, but alas this is truly the one and only app that lets you increment your logs in a deeply custumisable way. With the inclusion of rewards and achievements the app became the most powerful tracking tool I know of, and all that with all custom values. Greatly appreciate even the fact that it exist. The app is totally usable with most of its features trough the unpayed version, no adds no bs!",5,2020-12-01 18:23:57
RayR9,Dont underestimate the usefulness of this App. Simply... WOAH!! I would give it 100/100 stars if I could! You must definitely explore the app and build your game of life.

Tristan Tierney,"It would be nice to have the ability to set an xp/coins decay until a particular task is completed. Also, would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time (rather than editing its time and resetting it, or duplicating it).

Divinus FiliuS,"Omg... This is everything I dreamed of... I had been envisioning an app that could break down any aspect of Self, Life, in details and somehow using algorithms create a network of... that... daily cause and affect...from completing chores to Karma... so one can track growth, old/bad habits, new/good ones... JUST DOWNLOAD THE APP! LOL! This app is more than words can describe. Still feeling novice tho, excited to colonize it with all of my own ideas, etc. Bravo!!!!! Plz add calendar support!",5,2020-11-30 16:20:01

Jeff Rinderer,"I have only spent a day with this app, but I know that I will spend a great deal of time with it in the future. Pros: Highly versatile and fast. This app can be designed to fit any goal and can be tuned to fit any RPG balancing you want. Nearly everything is customizable. It's also fast. From first tap of the app to checking off accomplished tasks it takes just a couple seconds. Cons: Perfecting the customization to the RPG experience you want can take a long time, but it's worth it.",5,2020-09-09 01:38:51
IHC Enterprises,"Tried 3 top rated (at time), as once a 'pen & paper' Dungeon Master, I found this app to be a nice blend of functionality and fantasy... The interface is user friendly, and sub-screens are nicely inter-connected, easy to navigate.

Wish calendar wasn't 'paid', but certainly understand! So far, no obnoxious ads...",5,2020-09-15 23:05:58
Christopher Miller,"I love using this app for myself to help me prioritize/organize my time for school, homework, and playing. One thing I would love to see in here is an option where you can have multiple characters so a parent can get the app on their phone and make a character for each child so that they can keep track of what their child has done and what rewards they can have, ex: playing games, extra dessert, screen time, etc.",5,2020-09-06 22:34:32

Cody Green,"Hi, I just started using this app a few days ago and I'm absolutely blown away. It's kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the UI is so customisable while being clean. I have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added? Eg. I'm reading a book and have that as a recurring task but I'd like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily. Subtasks don't show in the widget as well. This app is still amazing and great work on everything so far!",5,2020-08-02 13:28:22
Rylan Kennedy,"Most amazing task organizer. Everything is customizable and easy to understand. Functions perfectly whether you use every detail of the app or just basic task lists. I'm Pavlov-ing myself with the task completion noise and my serotonin levels are through the roof.

Xandra Hale,"I love the app and it's customizablity with some notes; repeats are confusing and not easy to work about (for instance repeat times during one day versus general repeats), moving tasks to different days (calendar drag?) , can set specific times on multiple reminders, making routines, changes easy to lose when pressing back, and unable to manually order tasks by preference in list form. Adding stars for great responsiveness and care of creator =D",5,2020-08-10 09:15:11
Fiyu Think,The developer is pure genius. Well execution on customizable gamification app execution. I have bought a subscription as soon as using it for 10 minutes.

I am looking for a firm communication channel with the developer.,5,2020-08-09 12:44:13
BowenRobot,"Awesome reminder app. This one actually motivates you to complete tasks because it shows you your progress and the ui is easy to use. It's very customizable, from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks. The free version also allows the use of almost all of its features and doesn't hinder you in any way. I'm considering getting a subscription, but mostly because I want to support the creators of the app that has improved my daily life.",5,2020-10-09 19:03:48
Fernando Hurtado Bocanegra,"Everything is able to be modified. You can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life.

Peter Hasenpfeffer,"Been using it for a few days now, has really helped me focus on and organize tasks, even simple ones like making the bed or brushing my dog, things I always skip at least a couple times a week.

Annaliese P,"I honestly love this app. It's a great way to keep track of everything you need to do and it's very versatile, allowing you to customize tasks in a wide variety of ways.

Tom Tindall,I have only had it for a few days and don't fully understand every feature.. but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me. Probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual.,5,2020-08-18 16:51:09
Francois Arceo,"It's a great app, just the one that I've been looking for.

Brian Murphy,Love the app but i have a question. I have a morning routine set up with subtasks. Is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab? Also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them. This is by far the best app i have found for setting to do's for yourself.

Love from India ❤️ Some reforms are requested : 1) Activate Open Community (Highly Needed) 2) Please add weekly, monthly and yearly comparison statistics to give boast. 3)Dark mode can be made more colourful,instead of having grey progress/chart, colourful progress on black background may be given 4) Bug in reward claimed. Undo claims also reflected in claims history.5)Direct Option for doing a task twice or thrice/ month.",5,2021-01-06 14:28:39
J M,"Great app to gamify to do list and tasks. Very customizable in regards to icons, colors, and skills. I have not dived into the newest updates to see if there are new features. The downside could be an upside for some. When first organizing tasks it can be easy to get overwhelmed with options. No side game to slay dragons like one game to-do list manager I saw. It does a good job of being an annoying reminder to get tasks done (assuming you set deadlines).",5,2021-01-05 18:07:37
Jr Hunsaker,"I started using this app and fell in love with it within the first hour of using it. It has given me a greater drive to achieve something and have fun with it. I like how they have taken and put real life action into a game mentality, it makes life not much more exciting. I'm still learning how to use it but this has got to be the coolest app I have ever seen in my life. I get to have fun and not feel guilty about spending time on my device.",5,2021-01-05 06:36:07
Dotto,"Despite my complete lack of experience in RPG, I decided to try this app. Would definitely work better for someone who's played this type of games, because a lot of options depend on your familiarity with them. Even so, it works very well for me; basic usage is easy and it does motivate me to get off my ass and be productive. I quite like the graphics after updates.",5,2021-01-02 09:36:18
matthew mecum,Very innovative you will have to buy it though,5,2020-12-30 17:06:31

Sabine Winkler,"I absolutely love the app, I have been looking for an RPG app to gamify my todos and my personal growth for a long time, and this is the best one I have ever come across, and the only one so far that really motivates me!",5,2020-12-28 09:26:16
Senti Hetep,"In the few days I've downloaded this app my habit consistency improved 10 fold! Other apps don't give any incentive to get what's on your to do list done beside your own will power; which isn't a bad thing but the extra kick from the stats, the coins and the rewards you can redeem with them, and the achievements help. I also love how customizable the app is, for me at least being able to create your own rewards and achievements makes the app fit me personally.",5,2020-12-27 23:07:30
Lepore dotCloud,"I've only been using this app for a few days but it's been improving my life already. I am so excited to see the progress in my life 90 days from now. You can gamify the daily tasks you need or want to get done, create rewards, and start leveling yourself up. I watched a great video on YouTube about the concepts of gamification before I got started editing my setup and I continue to add tasks and rewards as inspiration strikes. Good luck on your quest!",5,2020-12-26 18:35:41
Kutyar Oztas,Best gamification app i see so far.,5,2020-12-26 12:54:45
Blake Centini,"This is an awesome app! I initially thought the idea of ""gamifying"" my life was a little silly, but fun. After trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than I ever thought! 😁 Thank you, this is finally getting me into habits I have been trying to develop. One thing I have difficulty with is the subtasks; once I complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task. However, the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5-stars! Edit: Issue Resolved :D",5,2020-12-25 08:18:39

Bradley Hill,The best of its kind,5,2020-12-22 15:53:11
Febbie Grace,"Have only been using it for 3 days but so far really enjoying it. I can feel the dopamine rush everytime I Finish something. For rewards, I included some ""vices"" I want to cut back on, as well as things that will help me expand more (ie Premium membership for Do It Now 😉) so it also helps me to develop more awareness with my choices knowing I only have limited resources.",5,2020-12-22 04:33:50
RayR9,Dont underestimate the usefulness of this App. Simply... WOAH!! I would give it 100/100 stars if I could! You must definitely explore the app and build your game of life. Be realistic with yourself and your goals. When its all set up. Go for it. Its so addictive and helps keep you productive 24 hrs. Thumbs up 4 the developer Smashed it mate!!,5,2020-12-19 18:59:46

Morgan Skidders,This app is life-changing. It does take a while to set up but once you're all set it's such a great organizational tool and so motivating. I have actually been getting so much done since I started using this.,5,2020-12-13 14:04:17

Will Pepp,"So it takes a bit of time to set up, if you want to turn your tasks into xp gaining rewards. But once you get the hang of it, it's absolutely fantastic. Highly motivational, not too complicated (after that initial set up) and makes stuff you don't want to do feel worth doing. I recommend the premium for the choice to personalise the character levelling system, as well as a multitude of icons that give it colour, but the base app is still better than others I've tried of the same style.",5,2020-12-11 09:39:51

Michael Harrison,"The best of all I have tried. Very friendly to including friends and multiple ways to get gentle, positive feedback from your efforts. Even though the language concerning the ""Hero"" avatar is decidedly male, the program is easily configurable for all gender combinations. This is the only version I found that allows a personal configuration of EVERY aspect of the engine so it can be as simple or as complex as I wish. One part I really love is the ability to create goals that YOU create.",5,2020-12-09 20:04:07
Red Line,It's working fine now. I already reinstalled and redo everything.,5,2020-12-09 15:43:34

Omar Cherifi,Great application . Thank you so much 😊,5,2020-12-05 17:37:01
Michael Parent,"This is by far my favorite ""RPG your life"" Task app. With multiple ways to track your goals, tons of customization options, you can reproduce character sheets from any game you want and create your own personal template from there with custom skills and characteristics that will increase or decrease as you complete goals! The dev updates the app quite frequently and is active on reddit, looking for suggestions and providing help! Great app, been subscribed to it for a while now!",5,2020-12-02 00:46:30
Juan Camilo Garzón,"If you've tried several times to make a to do list etc, and haven't been able to stick to it... This is a very nice way to do it, although it takes a long time to set up so keep that in mind, however it really feels like a fun way to measure your progress",5,2020-12-01 20:36:59
Sipos Istvan,"I have been using it for years. I do believe I have written multiple reviews with previous accounts, but alas this is truly the one and only app that lets you increment your logs in a deeply custumisable way. With the inclusion of rewards and achievements the app became the most powerful tracking tool I know of, and all that with all custom values. Greatly appreciate even the fact that it exist. The app is totally usable with most of its features trough the unpayed version, no adds no bs!",5,2020-12-01 18:23:57

Divinus FiliuS,"Omg... This is everything I dreamed of... I had been envisioning an app that could break down any aspect of Self, Life, in details and somehow using algorithms create a network of... that... daily cause and affect...from completing chores to Karma... so one can track growth, old/bad habits, new/good ones... JUST DOWNLOAD THE APP! LOL! This app is more than words can describe. Still feeling novice tho, excited to colonize it with all of my own ideas, etc. Bravo!!!!!

Banshee ㄣ⃒,"A little grind to set it up but it keeps me motivated when I'm in my depressive ruts, because it gives me a sense of accomplishment which in turn motivates me.🙅‍♂️It's truly a smart algorithm, it gives you brain feel good chemicals for doing mundane things that you may have trouble doing even though its easy and quick. Its very detailed so its fully customizable, and you can just tell that this app is from pure passion I love this app, but I'd like to reiterate the slow setup will take awhile.",5,2020-11-17 05:36:56

Tristan Spohn,By far the most in-depth app of this style. Tried Habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion.,5,2020-10-26 21:39:43
Neil Mecham,"This app is very customizable, which I definitely wanted in an RPG style To Do list. However, it does come at a cost, since getting everything set up how you'd like takes much longer than similar apps. Personally I think the trade is worth it (hence my rating), but be aware that if you're looking for something more simple, this probably isnt the app for you. If you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work, pick this one over the others!",5,2020-10-26 17:23:33
Tristan Tierney,"It would be nice to have the ability to set an xp/coins decay until a particular task is completed. Also, would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time (rather than editing its time and resetting it, or duplicating it).

Calendar is 'paid access', which is a little annoying, but certainly understandable... Popup ads are mostly brief (as should be), and far enough between, they are acceptable enough...

It's very customizable, from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks.

Nick M.,Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at!

Dawn Margetta,Great so far. I only wish I could set up one task for more than 1 day. It's kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily. If I could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing. Also making it so I can choose a time range would also be really helpful. Some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now I can only choose a time for a reminder. It'll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these. Thanks!,3,2020-07-14 20:43:33
Rudrava Roy,"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome.",3,2020-01-25 14:50:21
Keksi Krümel,"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"". If you want to do something 6 times a week, with the possibility to do it twice on one day, it will stay undone the other days (-1 *). Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating.",3,2020-02-10 21:41:38
Autumn Reese,It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row.

Jia Hui,lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order. habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them. if you do fix it i will purchase this app,3,2019-07-25 02:12:21

Brian Russell,"Super happy with the app! Bought Premium right away. Just one feature I would like to see. I know this may seem strange, but I would like recurring tasks. I somewhat expected it. Habits are behaviors that help me work towards who I want to become. Tasks are just to-dos. Thanks for quick response! Habits change behavior. Tasks are simply to do's towards goals. If you can make that strategy change you open yourself up to be supported by major productivity leaders.",4,2021-01-10 01:11:04
Aayushi Maheshwari,"Hello HabitNow team, I love loved this app, and bought premium as well. Just one suggestion, please consider the habits to be done if the person has done more than what he/she specified in the app. Ex. If one has targeted to read 30 pages of a book, and if he/she completes 50 pages, please consider the task to be done rather overacheived and same should be reflected in charts as well. I hope you got what I'm trying to convey. Great Job ❤️",4,2021-01-13 06:00:28
Jake Silver,Full featured habit tracker at a reasonable price. I tried about 10 different habit apps and this was the best for my purposes. The only other apps that appealed to me in this realm were 10x the price or required a recurring subscription. Pro: -Highly customizable habits -Very functional widget -Rich statistic tracking -Very reasonable price for premium Con: -Dark mode is not AMOLED dark -No syncing with other devices Either of the above two features would make this a solid 5 stars from me.,4,2021-01-09 20:24:06
Sueah Chung,"Nice app. Got the premium. A few basic feature requests to make it perfect. The widget shows all of todays tasks with no way to customize. Could we make custom widget lists based on a tag or category? Also, could the increments be set and seen within the initial widget screen as opposed to a separate pop-up?",4,2021-01-03 22:43:49
Different World,"The app is awesome. I however was not impressed with making dark mode a premium feature (although I understand the idea behind it) I tried to make a purchase for the premium version (I'm pursuit of dark mode) but got an error 'product details not found'... Overall, the app is fantastic! 😘",4,2020-12-27 22:00:56
Stanislas Gueniffey,"Awesome app but it lacks two key feature in my opinion: - A decent backup methos that directly connects to the Google backup solution or at least allows me to choose where to back up to (e.g. Drive) - If there's a habit I only ever do on a specofic day (say Sunday) there's no way to sort the to-do list so they don't clutter it every other day. Still, thank you for the great app 👌",4,2021-01-07 17:14:08
Bryan Santos,Love the simplicity of the app. The only thing I kinda wish it had is a Log In Profile because it would've been cool to Log into my Tablet with the Habits I created. But other than that I can't really complain. Straight to the point and I love it.,4,2021-01-11 05:45:06
bittersweet tea,"Quite a solid app but decided for something else as it misses some features that are key for me - manually prioritizing, faster UX (some things take way too many unnecessary steps - ex., the sorting options), feels a bit cluttered by including Task option, ...

Contemplations of a Stranger,"This is a superb app and I have recently purchased it. I have given it 4 out of 5. I would prefer if the developer adds a feature called ""overall score for the day"". Say I have 3 habits. Each habit will be calculated by percentage (for binary habits, it will be either 100% or 0). The average of all percentage score will be the score of the day. Also the developer may allow the user to add weight for each habit - because some habits may be more important than others. The sum of all weight must be 100. Can you please also add another feature to import data to excel file? Also please allow users to manually sort their habits. Now we don't have this option.",4,2020-12-14 13:13:19
Rahul Kumar Sharma,"Pro: Option to tick/count Customise category/habit Clean and simple UI Cons: - Surprisingly, No way to export your data in CSV Or XLS ( Reason for 4 Star) - No automatic backups. - No cloud backup. if your device damage/lost, forget all the data.

Siddhartha Bayye,"Exceptionally simple to use and love it for it:: Quick recommendations, it would be really helpful if I can change a habit measurement mid way.

Lauren Walters,"Great app to make to do lists and create habits. Like that it tracks how often you stick to a habit by percentage instead of a streak. I wish it would let me custom order the list, though, instead of only ordering by category or priority.",4,2020-12-04 06:38:42
Jenna Cheetham,"This app is almost perfect. The only things its lacking is the ability to use it across multiple devices such as phone & tablet. Especially after paying for premium.

John Alexander,"Very good app, and so far the best of the myriad I've tried.

Bren Eser,"I like the simplicity of this app, very easy to use casually. I especially like it doesn't require an online account like all the other data vacuums.

Jessica Payne,"It's pretty good but for me it's missing one feature. Most of my habits are to be done a certain number of times per week so it would be great to have a week view where you can see the ticks and crosses for each habit so far that week, for all habits at the same time (I know you can see them one at a time by clicking ""last 7 days"" but clicking on this for one habit closes this view for another). Then you can get a good overview of how much you have left to do that week.",4,2020-08-26 15:28:52
Rittika Chadha,I like it for now but even after buying the premium version there are a limited number of categories. I have 3 businesses & thus the single briefcase icon doesn't work for me.

That is super important !,4,2020-10-14 06:19:00
Dallas Sargeant,"I'm loving how I have set it up so I record behaviour that I want to change, stop or improve. And it motivates me to see those ticks at the end of the day.

Agon B,Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed.

Odokuro Kuro,"Everything is good, I bought the premium after 5 minutes used! But one question, why we can't create a task with a date which is the day before??? (eg; Today is 11 May. I can't create a task on date 10 May.

Lee Coleman,"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for.

Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.",4,2020-02-10 16:04:04
Polar Torsen,"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.",4,2020-02-06 00:19:35

Thomas Danforth,"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future. I have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a ""month-view- interface. Please make it more intuitive, let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past/future. Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future.",4,2020-06-11 12:44:14
Jeremy Theerman,Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.,4,2020-06-12 12:47:31
Cinthia Sanchez,"Have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium! I love it. But a few needed suggestions. An option to make a task recurring.

I also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do. Maybe a swipe would be nicer.",4,2020-05-09 15:05:29
Jean-Christophe Hamel,"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.",4,2020-03-09 12:47:26
Igor,"Just installed and trying out (I'll update along with my experiences). UI/UX is pleasant and clear. Looks promising. Love the Free full-featured & Premium accessory-features philosophy; I'll pay later on to support development. ISSUES: 1) can't change start-date & repetition of a habit; if it'll break history data, at least allow duplication 2) would expect SCHEDULED days to be colored/marked in the single habit calendar, as future overview; not just as achievement overview. ## So far, good job!",4,2020-01-25 11:56:56

Lucy Parde,"I like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits. However, there are a couple of things I wish were improved. 1. If I have updated all of my habits for the day, the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them. 2. I wish the analysis was a little better. Have some graphs visually showing progress. Also, how about showing how I am doing on my habits as a whole, not just the individuals? For example, if I have a day where I don't do any of my habits. Thx",4,2020-05-10 10:00:01
Eliu Moraes,"It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement.

Grant Farnsworth,"Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times.

Sha'Coya Zimmerman,this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,4,2019-08-04 04:24:14
César Jara,"I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it.

Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,4,2019-09-12 20:18:16

Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily.

Scott Van Kooten,"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.",4,2019-08-27 10:50:00
Ved Kapur,"Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature.",4,2020-03-03 20:19:41
Michal Gorecki,So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),4,2019-07-21 04:24:08
Bri Spangler,I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,4,2019-07-09 19:01:38
A Scott,"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect.",4,2019-09-17 00:29:17
Avery T,"Just installed this app, it is easy to use and is quite beautiful. I would love to have a vision board feature page that I can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature (spiritual?) before jumping to Premium, please.",4,2019-09-12 03:04:05
Emrick Rajomarison,Preaty nice but they could improuve the UI it took me some time to figure it out. And I know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app,4,2020-04-17 06:08:01
Pratik Pattnaik,I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.,4,2019-09-01 22:11:26
Martin Mendoza,Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!,4,2019-11-08 16:36:31
K K,"What if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week. I guess while adding a habit, this app requires one to select 4 specific days. Just a suggestion. It would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed.",4,2020-05-17 06:13:53
Jill Cleaves,Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.,4,2020-04-30 15:03:39
Donna Ashton,Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!,4,2019-08-11 13:34:07
Vicky Mileva,The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for,4,2020-04-21 14:33:07

Dani Boynton,"Great app, very usable and straightforward, but I wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day. Seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging!",4,2020-04-06 07:15:45
Abrha Cote,great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks,4,2019-08-14 02:18:59
miken521,"I like this app alot. It lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way. Only would ask a few minor things, like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit/goal & task alarms even when app not active.",4,2019-09-27 19:55:12
Haylee Armel,"The app is pretty good and I love the reminders. However, it's kinda difficult to edit already made habits, especially the number goals.",4,2020-05-01 17:50:16
Christine Walsh,I wish you could add repeat tasks on a weekly or monthly basis (eg. laundry every Saturday). Otherwise it's good!,4,2021-01-14 14:32:31
Aayushi Maheshwari,"Hello HabitNow team, I love loved this app, and bought premium as well. Just one suggestion, please consider the habits to be done if the person has done more than what he/she specified in the app. Ex. If one has targeted to read 30 pages of a book, and if he/she completes 50 pages, please consider the task to be done rather overacheived and same should be reflected in charts as well. I hope you got what I'm trying to convey. Great Job ❤️",4,2021-01-13 06:00:28

Bryan Santos,Love the simplicity of the app. The only thing I kinda wish it had is a Log In Profile because it would've been cool to Log into my Tablet with the Habits I created. But other than that I can't really complain. Straight to the point and I love it.,4,2021-01-11 05:45:06
Arslan Liaqat,Very good experience and excellent reminder system.,4,2021-01-10 11:50:40
Brian Russell,"Super happy with the app! Bought Premium right away. Just one feature I would like to see. I know this may seem strange, but I would like recurring tasks. I somewhat expected it. Habits are behaviors that help me work towards who I want to become. Tasks are just to-dos. Thanks for quick response! Habits change behavior. Tasks are simply to do's towards goals. If you can make that strategy change you open yourself up to be supported by major productivity leaders.",4,2021-01-10 01:11:04
Jake Silver,Full featured habit tracker at a reasonable price. I tried about 10 different habit apps and this was the best for my purposes. The only other apps that appealed to me in this realm were 10x the price or required a recurring subscription. Pro: -Highly customizable habits -Very functional widget -Rich statistic tracking -Very reasonable price for premium Con: -Dark mode is not AMOLED dark -No syncing with other devices Either of the above two features would make this a solid 5 stars from me.,4,2021-01-09 20:24:06
Deepak Sachdeva,Helps to schedule habits really well.,4,2021-01-08 13:56:54

Stanislas Gueniffey,"Awesome app but it lacks two key feature in my opinion: - A decent backup methos that directly connects to the Google backup solution or at least allows me to choose where to back up to (e.g. Drive) - If there's a habit I only ever do on a specofic day (say Sunday) there's no way to sort the to-do list so they don't clutter it every other day. Still, thank you for the great app 👌",4,2021-01-07 17:14:08
Anita Dizney,Easy to enter and edit items for daily tasks. Not sure yet how to do non dailies.,4,2021-01-07 15:15:02
Sueah Chung,"Nice app. Got the premium. A few basic feature requests to make it perfect. The widget shows all of todays tasks with no way to customize. Could we make custom widget lists based on a tag or category? Also, could the increments be set and seen within the initial widget screen as opposed to a separate pop-up?",4,2021-01-03 22:43:49

bittersweet tea,"Quite a solid app but decided for something else as it misses some features that are key for me - manually prioritizing, faster UX (some things take way too many unnecessary steps - ex., the sorting options), feels a bit cluttered by including Task option, ...

I however was not impressed with making dark mode a premium feature (although I understand the idea behind it) I tried to make a purchase for the premium version (I'm pursuit of dark mode) but got an error 'product details not found'...

Contemplations of a Stranger,"This is a superb app and I have recently purchased it. I have given it 4 out of 5. I would prefer if the developer adds a feature called ""overall score for the day"". Say I have 3 habits. Each habit will be calculated by percentage (for binary habits, it will be either 100% or 0). The average of all percentage score will be the score of the day. Also the developer may allow the user to add weight for each habit - because some habits may be more important than others. The sum of all weight must be 100. Can you please also add another feature to import data to excel file? Also please allow users to manually sort their habits. Now we don't have this option.",4,2020-12-14 13:13:19

Rahul Kumar Sharma,"Pro: Option to tick/count Customise category/habit Clean and simple UI Cons: - Surprisingly, No way to export your data in CSV Or XLS ( Reason for 4 Star) - No automatic backups. - No cloud backup. if your device damage/lost, forget all the data. I purchased the app and going to use it for long term because looking at the quality I trust the firm/developer to improve on above points which are bare minimum for it to be a complete and reliable solution Thanks 👍",4,2020-12-09 09:53:14

Agon B,Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed.

Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily.

Rishabh Singla,"Really a fabulous app. I have tried several of the habit tracking apps. This is by far one of my favourite as it combines daily habit tasks with some ad hoc tasks for day to day life. Only one feature I miss in this app is the ability to select the snooze time. Ex. Whether I want to snooze for 1 hour or 1 day etc. Atleast some standard options. Currently it gives only 1 option. Apart from that, it's the best app",4,2020-06-12 20:53:43
Jeremy Theerman,Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.,4,2020-06-12 12:47:31
Thomas Danforth,"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future.

Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future.",4,2020-06-11 12:44:14
Novelle Myers,I wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit I want in any order I want. It lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way I need it.

rajesh kumar nayak,Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.,4,2020-05-23 06:15:13
K K,"What if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week. I guess while adding a habit, this app requires one to select 4 specific days. Just a suggestion. It would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed.",4,2020-05-17 06:13:53
Kashif Faraz,"Does the best balance between tasks and habits! Very light-weight, easy to use. Best statistics, habit score features. Most task manager/habit tracker apps have way too many features but don't even fulfill the basic requirements. Moreover, they are full of ads/disabled features and require a subscription, which is totally worthless. This app can be used completely for free. But once you start using, you would be more than willing to do the one time purchase, which itself is nominal.",5,2020-12-16 13:00:14
Hark,"Great app, just misses a couple of small features but overall it's very well made and looks good. I'd love to see a way to edit a habit type (yes/no or numerical), and to have a 'between' option for the numerical ones. I'm not worried tho, the dev(s) obviously have good quality standards and I'm sure they'll keep updating it. I only wish my own devs co-workers had the same passion for what they do. Keep up the good work! Edit : 5€ has always been my sweet spot to go premium on an app, so yay !",5,2020-12-25 08:11:14
Remus Petrescu,"Simple and amazingly useful. No useless clutter of thousands of useless functionalities. I would though like one thing, being able to group habits into goals (so for example i'd have the goal of learning a new thing and i would havi various habits including some learning a bit everyday and practicing everyday, both pushing towards that goal).",5,2021-01-10 08:27:13
Stephen Murphy,"Agree with other review, an overall score would be great. Then you could set yourself a target of hitting at least x% overall and it would be much easier to keep track of progress. Rather than checking each individual habit. No complaints at all, though. Premium is worthwhile. Keep up the good work.",5,2021-01-12 00:05:24
Dena Johnson,"Awesome app. So easy to use. Even the free version is extremely useful, but I upgraded to premium to get additional benefits. At only $4.99 (one time only), it seems to be a bargain. It's helping me to be much more productive and organized. Plus, I'm finally taking some weight off with my reminders to drink water and avoid processed carbs. When I don't get all my tasks done in a day, it just rolls it over to the next day. I can't find anything to complain about. Well designed and executed.",5,2020-12-19 16:25:03
Zerubel Herensuge,"Very helpful for me to keep track of little things that depression and ADHD make difficult. Used in tandem with Medisafe and Brain Focus, I've got a much better grip on my day to day. The only improvement I'd like is the option to change notifications and alarms - the default alarm tone is okay, but not one that I'd pick if I had a choice. Edit: still don't have a way to change my ""default"" alarm tone without a third party app, and I'd still like to set different tones and reminders per task.",5,2020-12-31 07:02:40
Ana Schau,"I love this app as it helps me to keep track of things and it is my personal planner. I also love how it works offline too I would love it though if you guys could add an option which allows you to have a certain task or habit completed a certain number of times before it is completed, rather than just having to keep making a seperate task each time I want to remember to do something a certain number of times before it's done.",5,2021-01-04 14:02:37
Zach Marvin,"Honestly best experience I had with a habit tracker. I tried a few but to do anything you *had* to subscribe. With habitnow, you can use most features before going pro, and pro is just a one time payment anyways. You're able to do so much on this and the home screen widget is exactly what I was looking for.",5,2021-01-06 02:21:44
Sinister 1,"Excellent app ! I had been using ""to do"" lists to keep track of or stay motivated with certain things. A normal day my list may say 1)grocery store 2)pay bill 3)don't smoke 4)at least walk if you're not going to gym etc etc ! Until this app I've never thought of separating them as ""goals-habits-tasks"" etc and this is SUPER HELPFULL as you can look at your progress is simple graphs and it spells it all out for you ! For me its indispensable!",5,2020-12-20 23:36:51
Mohit Jain,Love this app. Explored multiple options before deciding on this one. The free version is good but it is worth paying the premium. The only thing missing is a weekly dashboard that gives a weekly snapshot of all my habits at once.,5,2021-01-05 00:09:07
Ell,"I never rate apps but this is the best habit/task/tracker app I've ever used, and the only one I've ever stuck with. It's simple, powerful, extremely easy to customize, and intuitive to use. The one-time premium purchase is completely worth the price for the expanded features. I've eliminated every other paper planner, calendar, listpad, and app. Everything is in one place and I'm actually getting things done and feeling good about building habits! 11/10 stars.",5,2020-11-27 21:18:39
Jamie Rasmussen,** update: thank you for the quick response. I will give it a try!😊 I love the app!! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I got a new phone and I can't find where to sign in so I can have my premium and see all my habits I logged.😒,5,2021-01-07 20:29:46
Ella,"Amazing app! I like to procasinste a lot, and this really helped! Now my life isn't as stressful because of last minute projects, personal hygiene, etc. Other apps were good as well, but the alarm feature really just knocked me out of watching random cat videos for 5 hours straight, and actually doing something! Only complaint is that dark mode should be free, and free users should be able to have 10 free habits, but it is all but mild inconveniences. I'm going to buy premium soon, keep it up!",5,2020-12-13 22:25:07
Huw Thomas Vaughan-Williams,"Cracking app, I really do recommend paying for the full version. I now track countless habits and targets which are keeping me focused on multiple aspects of my life. There is great flexibility to the habits so you can select how you want to set your targets in terms of volume, time frame and schedule. 5/5. Changed my life!!!",5,2020-11-12 22:58:35
London Brown,I've had it for a few months and I've enjoyed it. The notifications aren't annoying and they're actually good for reminding me to do my tasks and habits. And when I don't use it for a while it doesn't keep sending me notifications which is what I appreciated the most. Some apps just keep sending and it's gets annoying. It just starts back up when you start using the app again.,5,2020-12-03 03:14:18
Karen Large,"Love this app. It runs smoothly and is easy to use. I've tried lots of similar apps and this is by far the most user friendly. I've even bought the Pro version, and I rarely do that on phone apps.",5,2021-01-07 09:10:00
Carly Whitebone,"Helpful app for keeping on top of things! An issue I'm having is every habit shows up in the list every day, even habits that aren't daily. For example I have one set for 1x a week, I completed it yesterday and it's in my list again today. It would be less cluttered/overwhelming if this habit didn't show up again for another week (or if there was at least an option of how soon after completion to show up again). An option for habits multiple times per day and year would also be very helpful!",5,2020-11-20 14:03:26
neeraj SHARMA,"Wonderful app, searching for long,tried & tested so many apps bt all of them were missing basic features.

Hanna Kaison,Excellent. Super easy to use. Premium is a one time small payment (like $5). Lots of features. Also has a widget! :>,5,2021-01-08 02:03:27
Robin,Love the clean interface and customisation. Small request: could you enable it so that the app doesn't send you a reminder/notification when you've already ticked off one of your tasks or habits?,5,2020-12-30 10:01:53
Dias Seraliyev,"Feature request: please add the possibility to set custom time when the new day begins. There are habits that I perform after midnight, which are counted towards the next day, even though I did not go to sleep yet. It would be more convenient for me if the habits refreshed at 04:00 AM",5,2020-12-04 18:05:35
Chi,I love the app so far and bought a premium package. One thing I'd like to have in the app is to be able to write your goals and goal deadlines I want to achieve in my life for motivation.,5,2021-01-06 10:05:55
Alison Empey,"I've only used for 2 days but it's already a very good tracker....and nagger.....haha....to keep me on track with what I want to accomplish...it also helps me keep track of my sleep habits (hours and quality) and also my daily ""energy"" points as I have a chronic condition that requires me to pace and plan my day.

danielle rizzio,So far so good. I'm horrible with keeping good habits for housekeeping and basic hygiene so my mom started texting me helpful todo lists.

Sydney VanAusdal,I've been using the free version to see if I like it. It's been a week and I'm ready to bite the bullet and pay for the full version so I can add more habits. I love the simple yet effective design.,5,2021-01-11 18:21:46

Rahul Rai,I love this app.,5,2021-01-10 16:37:44
Remus Petrescu,"Simple and amazingly useful. No useless clutter of thousands of useless functionalities. I would though like one thing, being able to group habits into goals (so for example i'd have the goal of learning a new thing and i would havi various habits including some learning a bit everyday and practicing everyday, both pushing towards that goal).",5,2021-01-10 08:27:13

Amanda Hotchkiss,Awesome app,5,2021-01-08 01:44:47
Jamie Rasmussen,** update: thank you for the quick response. I will give it a try!😊 I love the app!! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I got a new phone and I can't find where to sign in so I can have my premium and see all my habits I logged.😒,5,2021-01-07 20:29:46

Trax_NZ Traxee,So simple to track habits.,5,2021-01-06 12:27:02
Chi,I love the app so far and bought a premium package. One thing I'd like to have in the app is to be able to write your goals and goal deadlines I want to achieve in my life for motivation.,5,2021-01-06 10:05:55
Zach Marvin,"Honestly best experience I had with a habit tracker. I tried a few but to do anything you *had* to subscribe. With habitnow, you can use most features before going pro, and pro is just a one time payment anyways. You're able to do so much on this and the home screen widget is exactly what I was looking for.",5,2021-01-06 02:21:44
Aruna Subramanian-Spaans,Easy to use and handy!! I wanted to start changing some habits and have one place to track all my To Do lists.,5,2021-01-05 20:29:37

Yair Master Dorantes,The best app I love it,5,2021-01-05 01:58:30
Mohit Jain,Love this app. Explored multiple options before deciding on this one. The free version is good but it is worth paying the premium. The only thing missing is a weekly dashboard that gives a weekly snapshot of all my habits at once.,5,2021-01-05 00:09:07
Arson Jackson,Simple and works,5,2021-01-04 22:50:24
Ana Schau,"I love this app as it helps me to keep track of things and it is my personal planner. I also love how it works offline too I would love it though if you guys could add an option which allows you to have a certain task or habit completed a certain number of times before it is completed, rather than just having to keep making a seperate task each time I want to remember to do something a certain number of times before it's done.",5,2021-01-04 14:02:37

Dee Ray,I downloaded the app today and already became a premium user. I love it but I just have 1 request.. I want to see a score of all habits combined not just each one individually.. so for example like sayin the total performance is like 70% .. is that possible?,5,2021-01-01 22:21:13

Zerubel Herensuge,"Very helpful for me to keep track of little things that depression and ADHD make difficult. Used in tandem with Medisafe and Brain Focus, I've got a much better grip on my day to day. The only improvement I'd like is the option to change notifications and alarms - the default alarm tone is okay, but not one that I'd pick if I had a choice. Edit: still don't have a way to change my ""default"" alarm tone without a third party app, and I'd still like to set different tones and reminders per task.",5,2020-12-31 07:02:40

Hark,"Great app, just misses a couple of small features but overall it's very well made and looks good. I'd love to see a way to edit a habit type (yes/no or numerical), and to have a 'between' option for the numerical ones. I'm not worried tho, the dev(s) obviously have good quality standards and I'm sure they'll keep updating it. I only wish my own devs co-workers had the same passion for what they do. Keep up the good work! Edit : 5€ has always been my sweet spot to go premium on an app, so yay !",5,2020-12-25 08:11:14
Dustin Stephenson,Love this app. I track workouts. Diet goals. Step goals. Great to see how constant I'm being (or not being),5,2020-12-25 03:03:20

Joel Bond,Great!,5,2020-12-23 10:39:10
Sarah,Too hard to group stuff to Today or Tomorrow. Annoying notifications stating why aren't you doing more? There are more pleasant and colorful and fun and nonjudgmental task organizers out there. I should be reminded of tasks not constantly accused of laziness. There are more critical things in life than a random to do list of house chores. The app is rude!,1,2021-01-10 14:15:34
Rahul Mahida,Simple todo app is fine. But the app keeps turning it's notification setting back on automatically even after I turn them off. This is intrusive and shouldn't be allowed. In same vein I cannot trust any privacy settings either. It's not worth it to use due to that.,1,2021-01-10 21:18:10
Jan Grünwaldt,"Good app - keeps getting better. But: Dear Microsoft, releasing an update that has a plan your day reminder with broken settings is a bit embarrassing. No matter how many times I turn it off, it keeps appearing.",1,2021-01-10 09:41:28
Tony Lee,My day tasks don't add automatically the next day although I set them as repeating. You have to manually add them. Widgets don't refresh too. Moving to something better coded,1,2021-01-07 21:36:29
Ken Parker,"This would be a 4 or 5 but developers who are this dumb and arrogant don't deserve that. The ""what will you do today"" is annoying and completely pointless, every current review complains about it, but it hasn't been corrected yet.",1,2021-01-12 16:15:45
Jo St,"Working with todos is ok. There are some major drawbacks: - when adding a new todo, it is not possible to choose a due date or reminder. After creating the todo has to be manually selected to add an due date or reminder. - Suggested due dates and reminder are not configurable. - When selecting a due date in the far future and selecting a reminder after, the date has to be selected again. - Every day a reminder to plan the day is shown. Even when deactivating this particular notification (it is reactivates). - Push notification reminders are deleted regularly and disappear. so, many things i don't like.",1,2021-01-12 19:25:54
Chy Rad,Can't pin tasks. Which means you have to manually re-add and sort any repeating tasks or tasks that take multiple days to complete. And you have to do this Every Single Day. This also means there's no way to schedule for a project. I LOVE the layout etc but to manually add tasks to 'your day' list and then re-order Every Single Day is totally crazy. I'm surprised this app is missing such a basic and necessary feature. I makes pretty impossible to use for any serious planning.,1,2021-01-11 07:39:54
Grant Jackson,"Love it, does exactly as I wanted, apart from a new feature that asks what I'll do today, every day, that I never turned on or was asked if I wanted to use... You can turn it off in the settings under ""plan your day reminders"" Update: What I will do today is turn off the ""what will you do today?"" reminder again",1,2021-01-12 09:03:24
Janet Bufton,"This app relentlessly turns on daily 9am ""Plan your day"" notifications I have disabled or set to 1x/week over and over. At this point I'm turning them off 3-5 times a week. I've given up and disabled all notifications through my phone settings. This makes the app far less useful for me, but we will have to agree on another app before we can switch completely. If you're looking for a to-do list to share across devices, I'd recommend another unless this problem is fixed.",1,2021-01-09 14:26:20
David Madison,Really annoyed I have to keep turning off the plan your day reminder. Will give a better rating once this is fixed.,1,2021-01-12 18:10:54
Sean Treanor,"This app used to be really useful but recently I've started getting daily reminders which I don't want, so I disable them, but they keep coming back. Then when I look at the support section there is no guidance. If you only use the app to keep shared lists (I transferred in from wunderlist which was great) this app is probably not for you",1,2021-01-01 10:51:13
Uno Dos,"Made worse by Microsoft. Took Wunderlist and made it not work. They have issues with notifications not coming up, for months now. What's the point of a notification app that doesn't notify you? Even exporting your data is not easy and it takes actual days, so it's not easy to try another app. Just annoying.",1,2021-01-13 09:39:42
Ted Schlater,basically does what you want it to. However you will get notifications everyday. Even after you go into settings and turn them off. the next day you still get notifications and you see in the settings that the notification setting that you turned off is turned back on. Have been doing this every day and nothing changes. so you will be stuck getting notifications you don't want everyday. They are hell-bent on making sure this app gives you notifications no matter what your choice. That is wrong.,1,2021-01-05 19:11:42
Nathan Leach,"Someone thought it was a good idea to add a ""feature"" that asks me ""what i plan to do today?"" EVERY. DAY. You can turn it off if you can find the option buried somewhere. I dont need a reminder app to suddenly start reminding me to set up reminders. Seriously who though this was a good idea to add? UPDATE: You can turn off the daily reminder BUT IT WILL TURN ITSELF BACK ON. Also, WHY do I need a Microsoft account? What if I dont want to sync reminders to anything outside my phone? So bad!",1,2021-01-04 17:59:57
Shane James,"This has consistently been a great app, until the last while where updates have implemented really annoying functionality that isn't staying toggled off. I do not want or need a reminder to plan my day, and when I turn it off it should remain off until such time that I turn it back on. This needs to be fixed, you are driving me and the people that I know who use this app away",1,2021-01-05 16:12:40
Beth S,"I have used this app for a long time and really loved it, but as of the most recent update I cannot turn off daily reminders and it is driving me nuts. I have tried to do it several times (including double checking after exiting to make sure it's still switched off), and it just keeps resetting. Please fix this!!!!!",1,2020-12-30 20:27:08
Saul Kniivila,"Update: app changes your settings to whatever Microsoft wants them to be. I turn off the daily reminder every day, and Microsoft turns it back on. Good app for lists, missing the ability to reorganize groups of tasks at a time, currently can only move one task at a time making it annoying to sort a list by priority",1,2021-01-07 16:03:06
Dinesh Nandlal,"There are countless reviews saying the same thing about the Plan Your Day notifications that are intrusive and annoying, and then to top it off the app now has a bug that turns them back on no matter how many times you disable them. How did anyone on the To Do team think this was a good idea, and then how has it been two weeks without this bug being patched? Microsoft, you took Wunderlist and eventually ruined it like we knew you would.",1,2021-01-02 21:53:15
Tom Williams,I was enjoying this app until it started nagging me every day with whether or not I had completed the previous day's list. I keep turning this off and it keeps turning itself back on again. It's so irritating that if it doesn't stop soon I am going to delete this and use a different to-do list app.,1,2021-01-06 11:44:33
Bryan,"great app, I wish there was an easier way to move everything from the previous day to today 12/27: changed to 1 star. havent used the app in a while due to having no reason to use it only for the app to send me a notification i havent used the app in a while i gave the app access to notifications for scheduled reminders, not to be bombarded with spam. Bye",1,2020-12-27 14:43:42
Alan MacDonald,Giving this a 1 star as it currently has a widely known bug that you can't turn off the 'what will you do today reminder'. Every time you turn it off it turns on again a day or two later. Will change this review when this bug is addressed.,1,2021-01-12 09:23:31
Jason Wells,"Had to uninstall because I kept getting annoying reminders each day that it's time to plan my day. I turned these off in notification settings, only for it to turn itself back on EVERY DAY. Tried turning it off multiple days, but it keeps turning itself back on. Get lost with this and fix your bugs, or just get lost if this is intentional to increase app usage 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",1,2021-01-01 14:05:01
Markus Henauer,"Every day the app asks me what I want to do today and every day I disable the notification for this. The app doesn't like this and turns itself back on to annoy me daily.

Abcd Efgh,"Uninstalled it daily asked me ""What will you do today?"" Couldn't find out how to turn it off without turning off the reminders of the tasks which I need. Why would it need to nag me on days when I don't have sh•t to do! Annoying cause I like it just exasperation. Kind of arrogant Microsoft thing. Yes of course you'd want this perpetual nagging for no damn reason because we're Microsoft!",1,2020-12-31 10:09:31
Alexis Gonzalez,Stop harassing people daily about planning their days. I haven't uninstalled simply because I'm hoping someone realizes the mistake they've made. But my patience for an added notification is very thin. Good app otherwise but that's all wasted because someone thought we were too dumb to remember to use an app on OUR own phone.,1,2021-01-03 14:09:55
Tony Gould,"Drives me mad. Cannot believe in 2021 there is no todo app available that works effectively. Surely this is the most simple app to produce, how do ms struggle with this?

Ivan John Carpio,"Problems with notifications since the last update. It was a great app previously, but now, i do not receive my notifications.

Please DO SOMETHING",1,2020-12-18 12:01:41
Chris Fryar,"Very useful app. Unfortunately, the notification settings keep defaulting to original presets. Why bother having an option for turning off certain reminders if they're only going to default to ""on""? Referring specifically to the daily planner reminder.",1,2021-01-12 15:06:40
Lars Panzerbjørn,"This is just absolute garbage. Once again Microsoft takes an excellent app, Wunderlist in this case, and makes it worthless.

Meghan McNeilly,"Not nearly as good as wunderlist was and I don't like that I had to switch...constant issues that I didn't have (or not nearly as much if I did). It often doesn't sync with my partner who I share multiple lists with and lately it has an issue even creating a shared list. When I create a list and try to share it with him it says ""we ran into a problem creating a link to share"" but offers no solution on how to try to fix the issue.

Stacie C,"I liked it until the recent update of the constant notification of ""what will you do today?"". It's so annoying and sometimes it even wakes me up.

Dave Cormier,"EDIT: has been broken for months, repeated updates haven't fixed it. Stay on the list I want! Obviously have to get a new app. Microsoft ruined Wunderlist. Used to work fine.

I fix it, and it eventually goes back to my day. I remove the widget and add it again, and the same thing happens. Wunderlist never did this!!!",1,2020-11-30 03:52:35

Hanz Chyou,"1) The design is not good (the list is too large). 2) Additional notes on to-do lists are useless (because they don't appear together with the list). 3) The unfinished task on ""my day"" disappeared every night, so had to reenter next day. 4) Lack of personalization options, only limited colors and images that available in this app. 5) Tasks with sub-tasks are not automatically checked even though all sub-tasks have been completed.",2,2020-12-14 18:59:41
Leddit Bee,Two stars for flagged emails and free with no ads. The bloated Outlook app should have skipped adding a browser and integrated tasks. This app is borderline useless; skip it unless you're a Microsoft power user.,2,2020-12-13 14:00:14

Kathryn Daniels,"Fine until recent update. It was a perfectly serviceable app for to do lists until it recently started popping up alerts every day saying, ""What will you do today?"" This interrupts work, music, podcasts, and actually takes away from productivity because I pick up my phone to see if it's an actual alert. I don't seem to be able to get rid of this without turning off all notifications, which would invalidate using a To do list app at all. Totally unnecessary.",3,2021-01-01 22:45:15
Chris K,"This app is a clear downgrade from the app it replaced. Wunderlist was great. All that needed to be done would be to use the EXACT SAME FEATURES as Wunderlist. Instead of having the same features, it TOOK AWAY features...and did it add features? I don't think there's anything new in this app. But it's strange what was taken away: Copy and paste. Basically every program/app ever can copy and paste. The app this one replaced allowed copying and pasting tasks. But for some reason, if you want to copy and paste a task, you can't do it on your phone app. You can't do it on the desktop app. You can only just BARELY do it on the web browser app! And even then it's not even copy and paste! You need to clone the task to a separate list. Then you need to go to that list and then move the cloned task to the original list. And it doesn't sound too annoying, but keep in mind this is a MOBILE APP. Why do I have to not only go to my computer, NOT open the desktop app, but open the browser and navigate to a separate webpage for a functionality that almost every program has? Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Why is that missing? (and no, right clicking/long pressing doesn't work on the phone app or desktop app. Wunderlist was a 5-star app. But To Do loses points for removing such a basic feature that was easy to use in the original app that I can no longer use because To Do replaced it.",3,2021-01-11 04:02:34

Amber Vignati,I am a previous long time user of Wunderlist but Microsoft acquired the app so here I am. There's some differences which is fine but this app has a tendency of being horribly unreliable. The repeating reminders seem to randomly get turned off or just never push to my phone. I've checked and double checked my phone to make sure a battery saving mode isn't the problem.. it appears to be an odd inconsistency solely with To Do. This problem occurred on my old phone and continues on my new one.,3,2021-01-02 15:51:35
Doug Johnston,"Yay, my previous issue was fixed! HOWEVER ... now, very annoying glitch: ""Plan my day"" reminders just will NOT stay shut off. Very irritating. Not sure if a glitch or conspiracy.

Neha Majgaonkar,So I'm using this app for getting into routine. I was very much fond of wunderlist and its amazing functionalities until you guys shut it down.

Chris K,"This app is a clear downgrade from the app it replaced. Wunderlist was great. All that needed to be done would be to use the EXACT SAME FEATURES as Wunderlist. Instead of having the same features, it TOOK AWAY features...and did it add features? I don't think there's anything new in this app. But it's strange what was taken away: Copy and paste. Basically every program/app ever can copy and paste. The app this one replaced allowed copying and pasting tasks. But for some reason, if you want to copy and paste a task, you can't do it on your phone app. You can't do it on the desktop app. You can only just BARELY do it on the web browser app! And even then it's not even copy and paste! You need to clone the task to a separate list. Then you need to go to that list and then move the cloned task to the original list. And it doesn't sound too annoying, but keep in mind this is a MOBILE APP. Why do I have to not only go to my computer, NOT open the desktop app, but open the browser and navigate to a separate webpage for a functionality that almost every program has? Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Why is that missing? (and no, right clicking/long pressing doesn't work on the phone app or desktop app. Wunderlist was a 5-star app. But To Do loses points for removing such a basic feature that was easy to use in the original app that I can no longer use because To Do replaced it.",3,2021-01-11 04:02:34

Prrajwal R Patill,"The reminder pop ups have no options of snooze or reset apart from 5/15 /30mins which defeats the purpose. The pop ups are full screen and buzz with an annoying vibration with no option in the settings to alert this. UI is clunky imo. No calendar view for a to do lists app. The outlook calendar is a whole other series of issues. I'm beginning to go off Microsoft in general because of the bug ridden even though feature heavy softwares. Can't drag and drop subtasks, seriously?!?!?! Makes it useless for planning anything and limits it to a grocery lists /shopping lists app because the subtasks no longer work as subtasks without the option to reorder. The widget is unusable, shows a blank screen on scrolling. The lack of segregation of over due tasks and today's task in the planned tab adds to the mess that the whole planned list is. Am I really expected to click on add to my day everyday for tasks I've already set dates and reminders for?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

With Wunderlist, you could have a separate ""important"" list for each category.

Few things Trello had that I REALLY wish To Do had: Template Tasks Grouping subtasks to delete a whole section if it doesn't apply instead of the painful 1 by 1 with ToDo And Love the My Day section, it's nice to focus and not get overwhelmed with everything. I wish you could plan for ""tomorrow"" in the same manner or have a time setting for us night owls for the reset time 😄",4,2020-11-25 16:48:49

David Schwindt,"I do enjoy the app. I create my grocery list and things to do when I need them created. What I don't like is that I continue to get a reminder to plan my day.

If it is a programming issue, please fix.",4,2020-12-29 15:08:15

Kristina Reed,"This app is almost perfect. It would be great if there was a layout that looked like an actual planner. That way I could view my tasks, assignments, etc. for the entire month. Not just daily or weekly. Overall, it's a great app and I would highly recommend it.",4,2020-11-23 23:35:42
Denis,"Great app but as others pointed out already, the daily notifications can't be disabled from the app. TIP: to disable this, go to settings -> application notifications and disable notifications for To Do. Problem solved!",4,2021-01-02 11:25:28
Scott McColl,"We are using this as a joint list to get things in order while we pack up and move. Though you can star and press 'in order of importance.

ARBIND ACHMan,"Actually I was using this app in my laptop from past 2months and actually I love it as it helps me keep the track of my day and recently downloaded it for my phone...but the interface of this app could have been more attractive and easier to use!! I know the potential of Microsoft, they can and they have achieved heights so it'll be helpful if they improve its interface like there could have been some motivational quotes, more photos background, so I hope we get something great in further update",4,2020-10-28 17:41:50
Spencer Arnold,"Does exactly what it needs too. It would litterely be the perfect experience for me if I there was a galaxy watch app or widget or something, allowing me to quickly view and complete tasks via the watch. Other then that it's perfect",4,2020-12-27 22:37:53

Mathew Halpern,"Switched to this from Wunderlist, it's fine. But it has truly useless notifications everyday asking what I'm doing that day.

Rika Mead,"Easy to set up & use. My appreciation to the designers - they were thoughtful of user needs. My only complaint is that, when I upgraded my mobile, I could not migrate contents. I ended up re-populating the shell on the new phone. On the other hand, I took that opportunity to pare down and reclassify some older events. So, all's well.",4,2020-10-27 23:19:32
Nath Reyes,"I love using this app especially the repeat function and the ""My Day"" list, helps me BIG time on my daily tasks. One suggestion though, if there will be a repeat for every X day of the month (e.g. every 1st Monday of the Month) that will be awesome. 😊",4,2020-11-10 20:45:41

W S,"Great but missing key features. Would like ability to move subtasks around. I add a lot of sub tasks only to realize they should be broken down further or converted into a task.

Paula Conge,Widget won't refresh. It's always empty even if I just added my to do list. I'll have to remove the widget then put it again for it to show the items. It would be perfect for me if the widget works properly.,4,2020-11-25 09:25:47

Sandeep Kattamuri,It's a straightforward app. I like how it brings in data from all platforms and how it integrates with Microsoft. I would really like it if it can show the tasks from all accounts together that are logged in.,4,2020-12-06 06:33:12
Aaron Jensen,"Pretty intuitive and great for enterprise use. Integration with Outlook is nice. Really like the concept of adding/removing tasks to ""My Day"". Setting reminders and due dates is a little clunky. Would be nice to have quick options for EOW, EOM, EOD",4,2020-11-03 16:23:45
Alisha Singh,It is an amazing app to organise your tasks. You can schedule reminders and tasks for different days. You can add steps do your tasks and cross tasks off when they are done. You can also repeat tasks for everyday or every weak or once a month etc. I love it and would definitely recommend you to try it!,4,2020-12-06 14:38:18

Demos Papadopoulos,Great app for the most part. There should more consistency in UI across platforms in assigning date and time to a task. I'd like to a bump button to push a task to the future based on preset days or hours with one click.,4,2020-11-13 05:19:23
Charles Wiebe,Great todo app. I use it for managing tasks and grocery lists. Grocery lists are recurring - I mark previously completed items as incomplete to create this week's shopping list. Therefore i have a ever-growing list which is great but problem is finding previous added items vs adding a duplicate.,4,2020-11-12 16:45:36
Gabriel Cano,Super useful to be able to add tasks with substeps. Automatically syncs to my Microsoft account so I can check on my computer. Can add due dates etc. Would be better if you could link tasks to each other so you can complete them in order.,4,2020-12-13 02:09:39
Shaun Meeds,I manage about 25 multifamily buildings. I have never previously used a list like this on my phone. It has been a pleasant surprise the amount of time I have saved using this. Super easy !!!,4,2020-11-07 06:25:51

Mazen Kilani,"Microsoft has a potential winner app, but it needs a few tweaks: 1. Assigning tasks to lists is ambiguous and needs more clarity in the UI when adding a new task. 2. Due date without time is limiting as it lumps all tasks together, it would be better with a time option. Overall, a pleasure to use and has great potential with new updates. It's free, so value for money is fantastic!",4,2021-01-06 08:44:43

Les Valernipi,Migrated from Wunderlist. Works fine. Great to share lists such as shopping for food. Just add what pops into your mind and the next time you or your partner goes into a store you can get what is needed. I do hate that sometimes I have to put my microsoft pw in again since I always forget it. Wunderlist was a tad smoother. I'm adding that the notifications about how many tasks I have completed are not welcome and irritating and I cannot turn them off.,4,2021-01-04 06:08:16

Chinedu Onyejekwe,"I would have given it 5 stars, but the recent change that has this application asking me ""what I'm going to do today"", everyday, is so infuriating, that I actually went into the settings and turned off all reminders, which means I wont use this app for reminders at all going forward, and will strictly use it for dumb lists.

Everybody in my family used to wait until I was busy doing something else to tell me about what they needed from the store and they would assume that since ""they told me"" that I heard them or retained the information which made for a lot of disappointments. So I shared the app with the family so everybody can add to the list as needed for themselves. As far as my family is concerned, it's a life saver (for them 🙂).",5,2020-10-25 16:15:47

Jennifer B,"Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.",1,2020-02-27 17:46:35
Maja Cuic,"The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle.

A Google user,Edit: Still doesn't work. I suggest adding proper integration with Outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google in terms of usability and ease. - Before Edit: Doesn't show me the events already listed on my Outlook calendar. Every day is blank. When I go to add an event with only Outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar. I don't care about adding events (I can do it on another platform) but if can't even see my Outlook events then this is useless. Gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced.,1,2019-02-23 12:38:59
Esther Gabe,"What appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen. However the settings doesn't offer that option... Now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up... I liked the idea I could just turn on my phone and bang! the clock would just simply show me my schedule...

Vladislav B,"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management.",1,2019-05-12 09:18:39
Uddipana Baishya,Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!,1,2019-05-29 16:25:03
Oyelaja Taofeek,"Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only.

Pls fix it",1,2020-06-03 06:17:27
Clive Adams,"I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.",1,2020-02-09 21:46:15
GirlyTodd,Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless,1,2020-04-03 19:53:38
Danniy King,"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.",1,2019-07-22 10:43:30
Amber Barefoot,"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me.

Douglas Trevino,"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode.",1,2019-06-26 23:02:26
Lauren Wickert,"cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.",1,2020-01-31 19:47:56
Savva Bogdanov,Couldn't figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour. Also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle. Looking at a regular calendar is still easier.,1,2020-07-06 22:31:55
A Google user,I don't know why I can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly. when I updated the time to wake up at 7.30 am but the app keep displaying I'm to wake up at 6.30am...what's wrong? wasted my time keep trying to update it. This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.,1,2019-01-06 14:39:55
Amy Barker,So it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app. It says it does this so you can learn how to use the app. BUT it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo. So it's really hard to tell if I like something if I can't do anything on it. Something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app. Just saying. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm trying to save time.,1,2018-10-12 21:05:59
Peter Lidström,"It's pure discriminating to have to BUY an extension to be able to use 24-hour mode! Either make it free or let EVERYONE pay for the app!

Nomad Wolf,"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!",2,2019-04-04 22:42:59
William Seneshen,"I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this •could• be awesome. The design is great.",2,2019-04-03 03:37:52
A Google user,"Updated: I want to love this but like others have said, it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed. To get Outlook or any other calendar to work, you have to have your calendar sync with Google, which not everyone wants or can do. It also only works with Google's smart watch, not Android Wear OS smart watches. Great look and idea, but very limited by being Google only.",2,2019-04-01 22:11:05

Kaivalya Dance,"Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style.",2,2019-01-07 21:19:06

KDeepak Kumarbk,I really like the app. Is a must have for people who use calender. I gave 3 stars as the changes that I do don't get reflected quick. And some times it doesn't even update change even if I try to sync manually.,3,2021-01-10 07:39:38
Irun Hendaye,"Three stars because it has worked flawlessly unl now. Two stars docked because the new notification bar widget completely ignores the settings I give it on a stock Android on a Moto G range device, so the problem isn't down to the phone or a custom skin.",3,2020-12-16 07:32:38
Andrei Zabolotnov,"It's good idea but I don't want to sync the app with my device calendar, no make local calendar on device. I would use the App as a task manager. So waiting to the new version.",3,2020-11-25 05:30:15
Sarah,"Really great interface and I was really excited to use this app, but it doesn't work with Samsung Watches... bit of a let down. I was going to buy the pro version, but it doesn't quite make sense if I can't fully use all the app functions even if I do so.",3,2020-10-29 21:26:25
Jake Zade,Is there a way to set times without syncing? If I set a daily morning task for example then it will clutter my other calendar(s) with that task. If there's no way to set it so that I can do daily time schedules without clutter then it'll have to be 3* from me.,3,2020-10-21 16:31:44
Susanne Moseid Bryhni,Difficult to use and too often switches to calendar. Its great with calendar integration for those who want that but I think an internal in-app calendar and ability to sync it when you wanted to would be better,3,2020-11-23 17:33:54
Mycamlo Home,"A little bit too complicated for me at the moment. I was looking for something simpler. I don't like the lack of face options in the free version. I created a whole cute design and didn't know beforehand that I was going to have to upgrade to save it. It wasted my time. Sure, I could have read the 'fine print' or tutorials, but I think what makes an app convenient is not having to study how to use it first because it is simple enough to quickly figure out.",3,2020-12-10 05:39:34
Joshua Kybett,"Really good idea. Clearly shows what's coming up in my day and helps me manage my time. The one thing that winds me up with it is how it ""fades"" into the next clock-face. I decided to pay for the app to have he 24-hr clock display and I would much prefer if the display changed at midnight rather than partially showing tomorrow and partially showing today. It's really confusing to look at and makes it difficult to visualise the day as a whole. The lack of this option feels like an oversight.",3,2020-08-23 17:44:17
Daddy DiBs,I like this app but would like to see future dates to see any conflicts in schedule. Would be nice to have some font size selection in widget. No matter how big you make the widget it can be hard to read for those with less than perfect vision.,3,2020-08-27 02:04:18
bella thorn,"I really really enjoyed the app, but I have a few problems. first pls make it so we can add daily routines. bcs some stuff I have to do daily like take medicine or drink a cup of cold water and it's tiring to have to add this every single day so pls add the daily feature. second every time I need to add an event I need to go to the calendar and add it there. so I literally have to use another app to be able to use this one. pls make it so we can add events from the app directly. thank youu",3,2020-08-23 07:40:46
Dan Eisenberg,"Really cool idea, but not supported on my Wear OS Fossil Watch (Gen 3). I was able to hack it as a watch face via the Wearable Widgets app, but it's not optimized. Please add watch face support for Fossil Wear OS devices!",3,2020-07-26 00:19:09

Sean Sanchez,"This app is actually wonderful. I'm hoping you can add the ""forward"" and ""backward"" buttons on the widget (potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons) like we have access to in the full app. It would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then, say, click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time.",3,2018-11-04 22:23:03
Alaina Marie,"If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea. However my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar, and there by having it affect your calendar. I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?",3,2018-11-15 16:36:39
Kristen Beavers,"I really have wanted this app to work, I'd really prefer to see my day filled on a clock in such a way so I even came back to try again, however I'm having trouble putting tasks in! After a certain amount they stop saving. I'm also struggling to see the clock in a way that makes sense. It looks very jumbled. Best of luck, I love the concept!",3,2019-03-10 01:38:32
Desecration Smile,"It's pretty neat. I love the how everything pops out on the clock. Only thing is I tried scheduling things after 12 PM and it wouldn't pop up and I notice it only shows 12 hours at a time. If you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature, which I think is totally worth it. Seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything.",3,2019-07-26 06:56:30
Katherine Phillips,"We need an update!! I love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me. Here are some suggestions I have: add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task (I use 45 min.), more color options for tasks, an option to change the notification sounds for each entry, a 'push all back an hour' option, and more widget options! Thank you I love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades!",3,2019-11-27 16:03:12
Luna R,"a little confusing at first, but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app. one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar. like if you add ""eat breakfast"" it'll go on your calendar. so that's only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read. but besides that. it works well",3,2019-02-25 07:48:58
Mikayla Hellwich,"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone. I love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app.",3,2019-09-12 05:35:05
Reid Goeman,"I love this app ; the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense. Sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors. Also I've found the colors are very limited. When it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events, it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color.",3,2020-03-01 16:35:20
Barbi B.,"I love the overall concept, and, the diverse options for setup. Though, so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out. I've had the app for a few weeks and I am still trying tweak my layout ... visuals are everything for me. I believe, when originally setting up a few weeks ago, I was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature (To Developer: plz be upfront on the premium feature options). I think once I get it really working for me it will be a fave app.",3,2018-10-09 17:27:00
Ariel Lothlorien,"I do like this widget a lot however I left two stars blank for very specific features. First and most importantly I left a star empty for the ability to display battery status on the widget as I use this as my primary smartwatch face. Thus without this feature it is very hard for me to see the status of my battery at a glance and know when I should try to get a little bit of charging. The second feature is integration with Outlook calendar without asking for permission for the entire account if it needs to ask for permissions at all, as my workplace has very high security requirements. For each of these features implemented I will add another star.",3,2018-10-07 00:27:13
Shafi anwar,"The app is really useful, one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time, unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget, if you can solve this, this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app. Thank you.",3,2019-11-04 04:22:21
Habib Forootan,"This is a great app but... I purchased it to be able to use it with my Samsung gear s3, little did I know that I can't use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear (which I found out later my bad). So, will you be working on making this app compatible with Samsung gear? That would open your market quite a lot with Samsung gear users. I've been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn't work smoothly at all. Please work on that if you can, thanks!",3,2019-02-22 22:38:01
Ankitha Vinod,"This is actually really useful, given the kind of arrangement they chose - showing tasks like the arms of a clock so it's really convenient for us to know , at what time which tasks are there to complete. But the problem is that when there are more than one task at the same time, the texts superimpose on each othr and we can't read thm. Considering they use Google calender to set up the tasks, I feel like Google calender itself & its widget is more useful than this. But 5/5 for User Interface🤩",3,2020-06-30 03:36:05
Marc Jackson,"Nice app! I just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie... 35, 30, 7:35, 30, 8:35, 30, 8:35. it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious. How can I remove these? UPDATE TO REPLY: Thank you, but I am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use. Can this function be disabled?",3,2019-07-22 04:40:16
Susanna LeBeau,"When I first downloaded this app I loved it. I enjoyed being able to see my day at a glance and everything was working fine. For some reason the widget will not open the app for me anymore and I have no idea how to fix it. I tried to uninstall the app and install it again and it still doesn't work. Anybody has any suggestions, I'm open to them. I use an android. Just to clarify, the app itself is still working, the widget is not.",3,2019-12-09 06:02:04
Joshua Little,"I like this app a lot, it is refreshing but to be 5 stars I should have more flexibility in setting intervals, like selecting days of the week so I can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat. When I add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default, I'm using the app to plan my day primarily. Finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time, with the new end time shortly after, say 30 min later. That would be a 5 star app.",3,2020-01-29 18:51:49
R L,"The app is useful on the phone and tablet. I purchased it believing that it would also work on my smartwatch as displayed in the pictures. You will only get reminders, not a watch face. The picture of the smartwatch is misleading. Either develop the watch face app or remove the picture of it.",3,2018-11-03 12:57:53
Io,I would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize European daylight saving time. I've gone through the settings twice. This is a deal breaker I'm afraid. I would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where DST is rightfully ignored. The main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed 👌👌,3,2019-04-27 17:51:01
Bilal Ahsan,Well this is awkward but I cant even find widget option for this app in phone. Downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version I believe.

V Tegara,"Downloaded yesterday and was pleased by the overall design.

Andrew Nelson,updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h.

A Google user,"The app works with the exception of showing all events on the app. The widget show 12 (9 hours ahead and 3 hours passed.) So when one views tomorrow's schedule in the evening, the app does not show tomorrow mornings event or anything prior to 3 hours before the current time the next day.

melly x,Great picture presentation for managing time. I always try to squeeze too much into a day being able to see day represented in a 24 hr clock with day and night (shift worker) really helps plan time more realistically leading to being more productive and less frustrated. It is great as links to google calander and also my watch. I can look at the widget at a glance and see what my priorites are for the day. Great for anyone with ADHD highly recommend. Can also custom your colour scheme ☺,4,2020-12-26 07:19:03
Maranda Carpenter,"Normally it's amazing. I love this app and the widget. Lately, though, the widget isn't updating like it should. It's not running concurrently with real time. I sometimes will look and it will be 5 or 6 hours behind the actual clock. If I click it to open the app, it fixes this issue for a little while, but it will eventually happen again.",4,2020-12-08 03:37:19
Aden Zoress,Very easy to use. The widget is the best part for me since its on my screen no matter what. Though there is a delay between me updating my calendar and the widget reflecting those changes.,4,2020-12-30 13:53:36
AB SERVICES,Great visual planner. I would rate 5 stars if it could sync reminders somehow..,4,2021-01-12 07:08:46

Adam Carling,"So far, I love this app. The only feature I wish I could have is the ability to link with calendars from other apps. It links with Google Calendars which is awesome, but I use a planner for work that I would like to add to Sectograph.",4,2020-11-25 12:02:56
Rob,Configuration is difficult but if you take enough time well worth it. The one thing I keep having trouble with is remembering how to change the application buttons on the side of the widget.,4,2020-11-30 07:25:00

LMAO Deceased,"Love it, great time management app, one thing I think would be great is if you guys would add a feature where it shows like a chart of all your time from the past say like past year, so you can see where you are spending your time cumulatively, instead of just the chart of how you spend your time each day, which is still super helpful! But adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great! Would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app!",4,2020-10-21 14:53:41

Aira Pauline Manalo,I think this app is okay. Almost everything you need for a planner is here. I just hate it whenever I can't access the app through the widget.,4,2020-12-03 18:41:20
Keshav Shylesh,"I don't usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great. It really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when I open to my home screen. My only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that, it's pretty great. Most planner apps don't work but this blew it out of the park",4,2020-10-10 17:58:43
Lara Anderson Seaver,"I really liked the concept of the diagram as that's exactly what I was looking for. The only drawback for me is that it takes the events from the settings/android calendar, which is not what I wanted. I would prefer to set events in the app straightaway. I will download it again if this feature becomes available in the future. :)",4,2020-10-04 13:52:11
Micky Stam from Greece,"Epic! BUT when I go to a later date like my future birthday (21st May 2021) and I touch the hand of the clock to slide it, it takes me back to 21st of May 2020! Why does this happen?",4,2020-10-17 15:00:48

Fionn,Extremely helpful for a visual thinker like me but the pallette settings are confusing and should be the same for all watch faces. Having different colors in the app and in the widget and on the watch face is distracting and confusing,4,2020-10-01 15:36:13
Ken Kaneki,"It's really great app and per partner for day-to-day life. I'm giving only 4 🌟 star because while selecting any sector time ,some time it shows different option or sometime it shows correct option but giving another time sector information.",4,2020-09-24 00:15:27

Branden Dyer,Great App. Love the layout,4,2020-10-17 18:00:05
Quintus U-Wei,"I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more.",4,2020-08-01 12:08:48
Patrick Bourne,Love this app! I have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in Google calendar and other organisational apps. My only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment (events) and the option to link a segment to a checklist. I have found a way to do this but it means I need to use a URL link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up.,4,2020-09-18 08:39:42
Matthew Sechrist,"I've always viewed time as a spiral, so this fits perfect to keep me visually organized. The app is very clever, fading out old events while revealing new ones for the next time around the face. Everything is customizable allowing you to make it look exactly like you need it. The only thing I want that would bump this to 5 stars is in app alarms. I don't like relying on the calendar's little one-time beeps. Allowing me to set an actual alarm I have to silence would be great.",4,2020-09-01 15:15:07
Palida Phat,"Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!",4,2020-07-22 01:20:49
Raj Kishore Singh Munda,"1)Add feature to Copy created event to add them further in the schedule repeatedly without hassle. Manually entering each event must end, it's a waste of time. 2)A feature such that just by rotating the dial of the watch by finger we can make next event in the schedule. Eg. We select duration, we click on okay and then we add title to the event to create there task. 3) An option to switch between weather we want new start time for the event or just continue with finish time of the last event.",4,2020-08-18 02:13:49

Amber Garrison,"Great app! It is working very well for our family in planning our days! Would like for it to fully interface with my calendar though - so I could edit from Sectograph as well. Otherwise, I think it is an excellent way to spatially visualize time management.",4,2020-09-08 12:11:19
Vuciri Isaac,"I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors.",4,2020-07-21 08:34:47
sapphireferal,"Useful, easy to visualizer what's upcoming and plan my day. Just a pity not able to track my actual time spent to see where my time went. So I'm also looking at time tracking app while using this as a scheduler review thing.",4,2020-08-16 15:11:23
Gelo,An excellent time keeping tool. Would it be possible to have a separate 12-hour widget and another 24-hour widget? And it seems that the manual update button in the Home screen widget is not working for Microsoft Outlook.,4,2020-07-20 09:37:26
Delphine Lumen,I love this app. I just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that I didn't have to create and turn on a calendar in Google Calendars in order to receive alerts for events in Sectograph.,4,2020-07-27 02:32:50
Nikita Vaizin,"The app is OK, pretty useful and feature-packed. Before it's usable though you have to spend a minimum of an hour to set it up. The UI is so-so too.",4,2020-08-07 03:41:09
stephane dumont,Interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes. Very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters. Time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity. Let's manage it as it should !,4,2020-07-21 07:31:39
Paresh Rathod,Very nice and innovative calander app only one thing is multiple widget like squre and rectangle also Widget event font was very small there should be option to increase font size to proper visibility....also it show next event instead of curren event... thanks,4,2020-07-30 14:42:11
Rakesh Nanjappa,"This app is amazing. I use it to show all my Google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock. I just have one feedback, I wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector, based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not. The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed. And thanks for this great app. Highly recommended.",4,2019-02-23 01:20:01
A Google user,"I really love this app for so many reasons. Above all it's keeps me organized and punctual. What I wish I could change, or maybe I can and just can figure out how, is how to make the widget color pallet settings the same on my OS Wear. thats why I bought the extra options innthe first place. My watch face doesnt even look like it does in the photos. Can I change this!?",4,2019-01-16 15:47:30
David B,"You asked me if I would recommend it. It's a cool app. I like the simplicity of my other calendar a little better. I know of another cool device. I call it a Lev Drive; interested? Yes, it's just theory for now.",4,2020-08-17 01:57:14
Yufei Quek,"EDITED - read second paragraph. Hi, not sure if I'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day. It makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face, but the list of events should include all tasks of the day -- instead of us having to ""fast forward"" the day until the events appear. I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though.",4,2018-11-14 06:28:34
Katelyn Lagace,"This is neat, I like seeing my appointments displayed like this. Wish there were color theme options for the free version.",4,2020-08-07 11:47:51
Marcel Montagné,"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",4,2019-12-18 15:50:17
Shafiq NobodyHome,"I've been using this app and the watch face on my Moto 360 for close to about a year now. With all my events for the day (and the next day) visible on my wrist, I can keep track of my calendar easily. However recently, the watch face is defaulting to 'Simple Clock' (default watch face) whenever I use the watch. It only affects Sectograph and it has been bugging me since.",4,2019-12-13 10:34:37
A Google user,"Really love the app. Helps me organize my time and schedule. If you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector, and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better. Setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded, and with some of the hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) not shown kinda bothers me. Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed. Overall, great app!",4,2018-09-17 14:26:02
Tara H,"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.",4,2020-02-29 17:19:21
Paul Sandom,I really like this app I find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your EVENTS very useful. The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events. The widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time.,4,2020-05-14 19:16:13
Antonia C,"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",4,2020-03-28 17:50:34
NajaNatrix,"I think it's by far one of the best apps out there. It integrates well with the default calendar app, and really helps you to track your day. Tons of customizable buttons, and even the clock face itself from the hour/minute arms colour and thickness/length, to the placement of the numbers on the clockface. I love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting, task or alarm. Widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen. Lock Screen display??",4,2019-04-07 19:26:03
Peter van der Meulen,"Made outlook play nicely by just importing my outlook calendars to google calendar. so that was pretty easy really.  I love the widget on my phone, it looks good, works nicely, it's awesome. The phone-clockface however can't be configured I can't find any option to add my business-calendar and some shared calendars to the clock face, it seems to only show my primary calendar (which apart from my own birthday is completely emtpy). (I'm aware that on Android one can select calendars, they just don't reflect over to the android watchface)",4,2019-03-29 10:00:46
Tanisha Desai,It's an amazing app It shows us how much time we take for homework's and etc. This is really useful app for me hope you get the same experience,4,2020-09-10 13:27:43
Yves Pairiot,"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance.",4,2020-02-18 16:00:32
Leah Cooper,"Excellent and useful! I wish I had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too. Occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back. The outside clock face numbers are only black? Can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them. The widget palette is great, but I can imagine customization with background images of clock faces, different hand shapes, and/or color gradients to make it look really impressive!",4,2019-07-13 22:47:02
irene hsu,I like it so far and I bought the 24 hours extension. The only complain that I have is the buttons that sit on the four corners of the widget is very hard to precisely click. I got very frustrated every time I try to click it. Most of the time it'lll trigger to move the widget itself. ☹️,4,2018-12-05 17:01:20
Satheesh Kumar,"Do you have plans to support Office 365 and outlook calendars directly.   Currently, I am syncing my calendars to Google but it's not a pleasant experience as the sync keeps failing on one or other calendar.    Due to this reason, I am stopping sectograph and moving to outlook widget :-(  For those who are on google calendar, it's an excellent app and the developer support is awesome.   I'm rating 4 only for the dependency on google calendar.",4,2019-05-19 06:13:35
Jeremy Bork,"This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel.

John Cole,"Awesome new idea for a productivity widget. Significantly more useful than a calendar or list of upcoming events. the one thing I would like to change would be the display of numbers on arcs.

Franco De Paoli,I love this widget on my smartphone! But I can’t get my smartwatch to have the Sectograph face updated...,4,2020-12-31 02:51:55
Jaiprakash Sewram,"Been using this app for a short while. So far so good. It's purely a visual of events, time, and alarms, while all the actual event management still happens through the Google Calendar app, and which I think is brilliant. Still figuring out the app.... Like how does one track time on it? 🤔",4,2018-11-16 03:50:34
River Stone,"Quite useful little widget. I only wish I had control over which calendar it used. it seems to only pick up the Google/Samsung and I would like to use the widget for my repetitive schedule AND a second widget for my daily planner. There is the ability to select which calendar within the Google app I want to use, but that just makes the calendar side messy. Two separate app calendar selection would solve this for me, unless anyone has a better idea how I can get around this? Still, thank you dev",4,2019-06-01 23:47:07
Daniel Lee,"I like it a lot until you have overlapping times for your schedule or events.... It's too hard to tell which one you are looking at cuz it only shows one.

Betsy Rackliffe,I use this to help me see what my day looks like. The circular shape helps me related to easier. I know and I have open spots and I know and I am busy. It sinks with Google so I don't have to import information multiple times. Really like it.,4,2018-10-14 16:00:30
yash gupta,A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.,4,2019-12-31 15:29:00
A Google user,This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement). Thank you for making my life easier!,4,2018-12-07 16:00:18
A Google user,I give it 4 stars but needs main edits: 1. There got to be alerts to remind one of the activity.. not just notifications. 2. Widget should be on lock screen beside being on the home screen. 3. This app can have the option of overcoming or controlling other apps; as to prevent distraction of following the routine.,4,2018-10-15 23:32:42
Raymond Kidd,"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.",4,2019-05-07 05:53:56
Fitri Amelia,This is a good apps. But I think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too. So it will be easier to check the plan. But offer all this is a good apps. Still find no problem up till now. Maybe I'll try the premium version to see the more features.,4,2020-06-04 16:41:27
I cant think of a cool username,Great. Really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time. Wish the interphase was more customizable tho.,4,2020-07-27 09:08:38
Bethany B,I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.,4,2019-02-25 11:52:45
Kalparaj Biswal,"Pros: I loved the visual representation of events and Integration with Google calendar. Cons: It isn't integrated with Google tasks. Most of the users would use Tasks to track their activities, along with Calendars. I would love to purchase the Pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with Google Tasks.",4,2019-11-08 12:15:30
Dave Ysrael San Juan,"One of the best productivity apps on the Play Store. I had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper I am using, on the preview. It is also hard to try and mix different colors to see. It would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color. Thank you.",4,2020-06-28 12:20:33
Felipe Sotelo,Useful but still needs more integration to Outlook ... I'd like to load my colour categories that I already have in outlook calendar in my visualization. Calendar by week numbers is also a must have ... I'd like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events. It could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time I wake up ... and so on. The potential of this app is huge,4,2020-05-24 07:44:34
Alfangelo Hickey,"Great app, switch between the widget and calendar directly. It can be improved, but is great in its current form. For some reason the widget disappears sometimes, needing to be re-added, which is annoying.",4,2019-01-26 01:03:27
Yoshi Maeshiro,"Had written a bad review because I spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars. Couldn't do it (and wasted hours!) until I noticed a nearly invisible dot (at least on my screen, I'm using the iblue app) near the widgets. Pressed it and discovered the widget menu! They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it.",4,2019-06-26 16:34:38
Paul David Utesch,Really fun view of your day. Still figuring out how to use it well. It would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but it's not a huge issue. I could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once I get used to it.,4,2020-04-07 03:25:45
Swetha Maran,The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!,4,2020-04-09 05:31:28
Sam Dickinson,"Very close to being 5 stars. There are just a few oddities in the user interface (and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing) who means that for some the word ""buggy"" might be applied. I'm more inclined to say ""unpolished"" in certain areas... But a great app none the less",4,2020-07-09 08:59:11
Katie Bergen,My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊,4,2019-01-14 19:13:48
Sarah Wattrus,"Im really keen to use this app, but the fact that it doesnt have an alarm bugs me a lot. I tend to glance over things easily so an alarm that I have to stop after reading my next event will be incredibly helpful.",4,2018-12-20 07:15:18
Chris Gray,Very nice setup. Thought enough of it to pay for premium. Couple things - add ability to change watch hand colors (arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see) - add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time (difficult to read). Watch = Ticwatch Pro 4g Phone = Moto Z3 w/Pie,4,2019-12-05 01:24:27
Simonne Palmer,"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar.",4,2020-06-08 19:49:27
Wade Williams,"it is a very nice way to look at your schedule. It also helps you determine productivity, whether you are scheduling efficiently and are you allowing yourself some downtime. It can use some improvements and I believe that they will happen.",4,2018-12-21 17:30:13
Jordyn Tanner,"I like it, but I wish I could go to the days ahead and see everything planned instead of what is just at or ahead of the time right now. For example, it is 5pm right now, and I can only see what's happening after 5pm tomorrow.",4,2018-10-28 22:58:07
Joey,Very cool app! Only thing I found is that when I update and remove an event from my calendar the widget doesn't update. the event stays in the widget. Also wish it had a setting to show battery percentage. Still like the app though:),4,2019-05-06 17:36:10
My beautiful one,"I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars",4,2020-08-01 09:22:46
Andres Hernandez,"Cool app! Can almost replace the other widgets I have on my home screen, but missing one feature (which is not the fault of the app, but a shortcoming for my particular needs): weather. Include weather and I can easily pay for this app! Still keeping as it is a good app!",4,2020-02-06 05:58:44
*Kim Zick,"It's probably the closest app to what I'm looking for. I'd really like to be able to either style or disable monochrome mode, and have the option to use the same style between the watch face and home widget so I don't have to go back and forth in the settings to make them match",4,2018-11-27 16:35:14

melly x,Great picture presentation for managing time. I always try to squeeze too much into a day being able to see day represented in a 24 hr clock with day and night (shift worker) really helps plan time more realistically leading to being more productive and less frustrated. It is great as links to google calander and also my watch. I can look at the widget at a glance and see what my priorites are for the day. Great for anyone with ADHD highly recommend. Can also custom your colour scheme ☺,4,2020-12-26 07:19:03

LMAO Deceased,"Love it, great time management app, one thing I think would be great is if you guys would add a feature where it shows like a chart of all your time from the past say like past year, so you can see where you are spending your time cumulatively, instead of just the chart of how you spend your time each day, which is still super helpful! But adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great! Would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app!",4,2020-10-21 14:53:41
Rakly3,How do i see all events and other day events instead of only today within 12h only? Is this what you mean by 24h clock in pro? Will it also show other days with pro? I like the app but some things ar not very clear to me. Thanks!,4,2020-10-20 19:27:43

Keshav Shylesh,"I don't usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great. It really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when I open to my home screen.

Patrick Bourne,Love this app! I have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in Google calendar and other organisational apps. My only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment (events) and the option to link a segment to a checklist. I have found a way to do this but it means I need to use a URL link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up.,4,2020-09-18 08:39:42

The app is very clever, fading out old events while revealing new ones for the next time around the face. Everything is customizable allowing you to make it look exactly like you need it. The only thing I want that would bump this to 5 stars is in app alarms. I don't like relying on the calendar's little one-time beeps.

Jean Nassar,"I've been using this for almost two years now. It's awesome that they show a 24-hour view, and the phone widget works great. I'd love it if the watch face could get similar functionality (e.g., expanding events to see the details), as well as new functionality (e.g., complications, using the central button for something other than switching between 12- and 24-hour views (since I'm always in the 24-hour view anyway)). A few tips for users: - Make use of 0-minute events on Google Calendar. They look good on the app, and make up for Sectograph not being able to show the to-do list calendar for tasks with set times. (edit: Can you add this?) - For longer events (3 hours, by default), you end up with a flag with the first character of the event name. I use a Japanese character or a number (e.g., for variable shift work) as the first character for these kinds of events, but emoji would probably work great as well.",5,2021-01-01 22:33:02

A few tips for users: - Make use of 0-minute events on Google Calendar. They look good on the app, and make up for Sectograph not being able to show the to-do list calendar for tasks with set times. (edit: Can you add this?) - For longer events (3 hours, by default), you end up with a flag with the first character of the event name. I use a Japanese character or a number (e.g., for variable shift work) as the first character for these kinds of events, but emoji would probably work great as well.",5,2021-01-01 22:33:02

Most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours (for example; gyming twice or thrice a day) the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you Another example of this would be:  Reminder: on every Thursdays at 7am and 8pm I should be reminded of (insert habit).

Rob Chang,"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.",2,2018-10-15 18:36:33
Sanjiv,"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily

Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this 
core feature right, then the app would be complete.",2,2018-06-21 08:41:59

EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service.

Don't do it!",3,2020-06-26 01:32:04
jioran C,"I was using journal but can't write much until my hand gets better so I was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time. Thought time line of this app would work, like all the icon and pre-made taps. But disappointed that I can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another ""routine"" If dev's can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine, that would be perfect!

Jerahmeel C,"Looks promising.

Bibi Todaro,"It's ok but I wish I could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one E.g. if I have yoga 9-10 then study 10-12 and want to swap them I can't just move around the blocks I have to delete study, change the time of yoga then add study with the new time. It's time consuming and not practical. Would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine e.g. from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over",3,2020-01-05 23:16:55

falling behind or are ahead of the time we have budgeted. I have my morning 
routine, but it has multiple tasks within it. If we were able to condense 
my tasks into the routine, it would make things look more organized. All in 
all a very good app if you want to stay organized, but I don't think I

I paid for the following reasons (1) one flat rate, no subscription (2) practical usage for a routine and can sync with my calendar (3) a moderate amount of flexibility in features (sometimes you need limits so it can help you narrow your priorities). My my current issue with the app is that it doesn't sync instantly when I make changes to my calendar. Typically apps have a time setting and a button.",3,2021-01-03 16:57:10

Alex Carrier,"PRO: Simple - use routines to schedule your week and it will repeat. Set it and forget, it will remind you. CON: Barebones - that's all it does.

I was also not able to copy/duplicate events, which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event. Disappointed in the app's scheduling capabilities.",3,2019-06-29 23:25:36

Alia Mirza,"Not bad but not great. Pros: 3rd party calendar sync, time line view, icons & colour options to customise. Cons: can't sync devices, no task list or tick box. More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look. Overall it's not very intuitive, needs more options & flexibity. It has some way to go. I've got premium btw.",3,2019-06-03 16:18:54
Kane Kesler,"While it has helped me be more productive, recently the notification settings are bugging out. When I tap on 'ADD notification', and select a louder notification (for when I wake up) and press done, I find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the ""opener"" (my default notification sound that is quiter).

Sarah Dawn,This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature.

Susanna Smith,Been looking for an app like this for a while! I love being able to coordinate things with 'tags' customizable by colours AND icons! I would happily give 5 stars apart from three things: 1. It would be great if there was an option to mark tasks as 'completed'; 2. I don't see much of a difference between the 'time block' and 'routine' choices (generally just looking for advice on this one); and 3. It would be great if we could add more than 3 tags to a time block or routine! 😊,4,2020-08-04 22:25:08
Hello There,"Seems like a very well made app. Very good for if you want a rigid schedule that has plenty of options for repeating patterns. One thing I would maybe look into adding would be a feature where you could set an assumed cost of an activity such as your daily lunch or dinner, or maybe your commute so that you could plan your budget along with the schedule.",4,2020-09-16 01:50:58
SAMA Mallick,"I have been using this app for quite some time and I'm really enjoying it. First thing in the morning I schedule my day, which enables me to spend a v. productive day. I've become quite dependant on it. I'd suggest to add a search option for tags. I have created a bunch of tags and it's really time consuming to scroll all the way over and over again to insert tags. Also, I saw a bunch of great suggestions in the reviews and it would be great if they are implemented.",4,2020-09-03 20:04:38
Luke 2,"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,",4,2020-08-02 16:26:11
Darin Sean Sablan,"Honestly a really good app for creating routines. However, I'd like to see a calendar view of my routines and be able to view more than the 2 weeks in the Schedule Tab.

Instead of splitting the long Activity when another Activity is set to times within it.",4,2020-07-30 10:17:21
Khing,"Okay so far as I have used, the app was pretty good. I read that this is s new one, and I like all the features present in it. However there is still lot of room for improvement. I have a small suggestion to make, you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not. That way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the Timetable :)",4,2020-07-24 10:28:52
Sam,"Its a great app if you want a calender or routine app. I really like the colour coded tags for different types of activities. I would love to see a separate to-do list.

Elise Evans,"Excellent app!! I use it every day. I've got a few small requests though, if possible! Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the ""add this gap to previous/next activity"" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!",4,2018-10-22 22:28:28

Mahesh S Nair,I wish to buy the pro version and also encourage my friends and family to do the same but hope you can make some improvements to the app. The UI looks very minimal which is a vanilla android template for an app development.

It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC.

Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.",4,2019-09-03 09:25:27

Michelle Brydon,I really like this app to establish a new routine. I strongly rely on my calendar at work but setting it up for routines outside of work is tedious.

Edit: I don't know how to answer so I'll edit and hopefully it gets trough. If I can get something back, I would like the choice to go horizontal (make it a choice on pro). A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did.

Anna Waraksa,"After installing and uninstalling several other apps I finally found this one and it suits my needs the best. I like the appearance and all the features.

I set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table, then it plays a little song. I love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons, put their dishes in the sink, grab their notebooks then sit at the table. I love that I don't have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore.

Jordy Devoldere,"This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves.",4,2020-05-02 13:40:45

Prince Asiamah,"So I just downloaded this app and it's exactly what I'm looking for in a planner app/productivity app My only issue is that there's no sync between the app on some of my other devices, I hope the developers can include that feature as I do most of my planning on my tablet and would love to have the app on my phone synced with what I put on the tablet.",4,2021-01-14 06:47:29
Jana Engländer,"Love the app so far - it's great for helping me organize my daily routines. What would be really helpful though, is if I could insert a Block/Event into a specific day and time frame and have this override the normally scheduled routine for that time period. Right now it shows both the Block and the normal routine for that time frame in the schedule, as if I could do both the Block tasks and normal routine tasks simultaneously... which doesn't make sense to me.",4,2021-01-05 14:35:56

Morgan Wendel,"As someone who procrastinates constantly and needs a routine to keep myself focused, this app is amazing. The constant notification with personalized icons makes it so easy and helpful to keep track of what's going on and what I need to do next. No, this app isn't perfect.

Duy Nguyen,"As a paid user, I must say this is an excellent, very clean and cool app (one of the best purchases I have made)! One quick suggestion tho, it would be really nice to have a classic calendar view of the blocks (with optional toggle to show/hide daily routines) since it was a bit difficult to visualize my schedule, but overall nice job!",5,2020-12-16 09:08:59

Natalie Cone,"I loved this all before, but with the new updates, it is the BEST!! I lose track of time easily and this allows me to make a schedule and choose which items give a notification. This helps me SO MUCH to stay on track throughout the day. Perfect for an ADHD brain! I'm a homeschool mom with a busy schedule and I struggle to keep the household running efficiently. This app is a gift to me!! Additionally ... I haven't encountered a single ad. ❤️❤️ Well-designed app. HUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS!!",5,2020-09-15 12:02:15
Tabi Burleson,"This app is freaking phenomenal! Instead of having a billion alarms in my phone that I have to go over all the time, I can just set up schedules and go about my day. I have my daughter's school schedule since we're distance learning. My son's band schedule. My work routine. Even simple things like when to brush my teeth so nothing gets missed in the chaos that is quarantine life. I have ADHD, so being hyper-organized is super important for me, and this app cuts out so much stress!",5,2020-09-18 14:14:31
Naymur Rahman,"This is the best app, This app really affect my bad routine.",5,2020-12-05 17:57:57
Allen Irizarry,I needed a simple app that I can schedule my day throughout. This has a VERY simple interface and a very visually appealing aesthetic. I love it so far! What would really fit the bill even better is if I can drag and drop blocks. Sometimes I have to shift priorities and it messes up my schedule and I need to manually go in and change things in every block thereafter.,5,2020-08-20 14:13:35
Janie V,"Love the app, it serves its purpose well. I've found that routines are a must for effective and long term habit building. The latest update allows 2 tags per time slot which is awesome. But, the notes now visually appear seperate, or disconnected from the timeslot and tag. It's really just an aesthetic issue, but I do wish it were fixed.",5,2020-08-17 21:19:15
Tristan Brandt,"I've been using this app for the past 4 years now, and I must say, this new UI update was the single biggest improvement that I've ever experienced in an app. The new tag system simplifies everything, and it looks so much better. I'd always struggled with giving a block of time multiple equally important activites, but the new design caters for it upfront. It may sound really small, but it used to be the most annoying part of the experience for me, and now it's my favorite thing about the app!",5,2020-07-29 19:35:17
Elisa,"I have remote learners and this app is so helpful when keeping track of their school schedule. Highly recommended. I have the free version so I'm not sure if the pro version allows you to designate a specific routine within a specific date within a calendar app, but I can import a specific routine per day with the free version and it's been very useful.",5,2020-09-11 12:43:20
Norah Neo,It is a very good app There are some problems tho like at first i didnt know how to off the alarm so like i was quite confused but after a while I figured it out... i think it would be better if they did a more detailed tutorial but of course this is just a very minor issue and I think this app deserves 5 stars because i really is a great to do app ! Like there are many features in here that i would not have expected to be in a free app,5,2020-08-10 04:10:48
Luke Bannister,"Great app, it's absolutely perfect for what I do, the only gripe is that the comment section on the schedule block could be bigger, it limits me and I can't jot down everything I can. I hope the developers will see this message and extend it as I think it's an easy fix and would benefit a lot of users very much, thanks!",5,2020-08-22 11:51:28
Unicorn with a Horn,"This app is my saviour during quarantine. Now that I have a schedule, what's up next in the day, my anxiety level has gone way down. I'm so glad I downloaded this app. I love how on top of notifications there's a voice saying aloud to what's coming up. A minor issue is that ""reading"" is pronounced ""reding"".

Sadhana Shrivastava,"No doubt! It is the best time management app I have ever used and I have recommended this app to many of my School friends. Help me: I have created my routine in one mobile and I sometimes use another mobile as well, I just want to know how I can link both apps to notify me on other mobile also or Do i need to create the routine again ? . I appreciate you guys for making this wonderful app. I am also looking forward to see new great features in the app. 🙂",5,2020-08-26 16:30:48
Sudeshna Kundu,"Its really a great app.But after recent update,it lost some features.Its not highlighting the current task in schedule pannel.Add this feature again in the next update... *EDIT : There is no ' now' icon on the top bar.By the way,the method of highlighting the current task in schedule option before this update was better than the present way of highlighting.😑 It's better to highlight the whole sentence instead of highlighting only the borders👍",5,2020-09-29 08:38:21
krystle kuan,It's great to use my daily timetable and hope it helps my life ^^ but I don't hear any sound/song when notification since yesterday. =\ TimeTune replied my problem and I just found out that it's my device setting is already off sound in app notification.. now it's working. No wonder. Haha thank you so much! I gave you 5 stars now!,5,2020-07-28 16:06:58
Vincent Baxter,"I've only just started using this app, but it seems to be exactly what I was looking for. It allows you to create customised event types, programme start and end times for events, set repeating events. It's simple, but not lacking in features. One suggestion I have is the ability to see a weekly view of the schedule.",5,2020-09-23 08:44:50
Grace Qin,I just came back from a year or more of not using the app (I didn't really have a routine) and I've gotta say the design changes are amazing. It's visually easier to navigate and edit. The ideas in blocks are great. Can't wait to see you implement more things to do with overlaps and such.,5,2020-09-19 05:50:02
Anniie Samuel,"This app helps you edit your routine anytime as per one flexible time.This is very useful for people like me who find it difficult to follow a routine but helps us to be on track and guides us to know what to do next. You can alot time at irregular basis eg a task can be for 20 mins whereas the other could be for 90 mins. The notification are at par and do good job at reminding us our next task. The information that one needs to fill in when adding a task, is accurate and is easy. This app is the best one and would not like to replace it with any other to use for my studies, also for this reason i would be looking forward to an app for the PC's or at least a web",5,2020-09-04 12:20:00
Dhanunjay Venigandla,"A great app but it would be nice to add a feature to plan a schedule for tomorrow( any further date) on the day before. Making a schedule the night before for next day is a hassle. It keeps reverting back to routines and the current day, everytime pressing schedule and swiping to change date is time consuming to add blocks.",5,2020-09-30 03:09:47
Zachary Sullivan,"I've downloaded this app 3 times in the past. Unfortunately, it can't force me not to procrastinate. But every time I decide to get back on a routine and use block Time to plan my day, this app is my go-to. It's relatively easy to use and understand, and it has all of the functionality that my ADHD brain could possibly handle",5,2020-08-03 04:10:23
Maxwell Presnal,"It took me a bit to get the hang of doing schedules that dont happen on a regular interval, but now i love this app. i use it everyday to keep me on top of what i need to be doing. i think its going to be very useful for when school starts up this fall, considering all of my classes are thru distance learning.",5,2020-08-16 16:52:09
Ultra DMX,"It's very nice app, granted it might be niche but it's perfect for me. However, I would like to see ""goals"" or tasks that has timer/Stopwatcyh and when it's finished, It's ticked as done. It will be a very welcome feature.",5,2020-08-14 17:59:21
Tulio Perez,I love the app but it needs a view that allows the user to see the schedule as a weekly timetable,5,2021-01-12 13:49:49
Rob Sorfleet,Great app. But I'd like to make a suggestion. Have an option to set the default day on custom routines to day 1 when activated. It currently defaults to which ever day you closed the app. And as such some of my alarms don't go off because they are on day 1 and the routine gas started on day 2.,5,2020-09-07 21:23:08
Gokhale Sarthak,"Excellent App!! I regret knowing this app sooo late😁!! The best Thing was the 'Customisable Alarms/Notifications' ... As a student, im in love with this app!

Lijo Lalu Korah,really made my life a lot easier. it just works.,5,2020-11-22 05:53:57
Katrina Rose,"Overall, I like the latest update. It's perfect for making schedules. I do wish the blocks had two catagories, past & upcoming so I don't have to scroll past old events to get to my current events. I also wish blocks still had the personal icons instead of only tags.",5,2020-09-03 23:44:16

jayakrishnan nair,I have updated routines and enabled it in programmer. I dont see any in my schedules. Schedules is totally blank. Later it got updated so changing review to little better because. But from the previous design to now i feel like i have to enter so much. Something is wrong with the app.,5,2020-09-18 07:46:10
annie anita samuel,It helps make a daily plan as per the period and is very fexible. Those who cant follow a weekly routine (like me 😂) should definitely download this app. It helps you experiment.

Taz Thomas,It is quite good for managing your schedule and having your schedule written down somewhere instead of it being in your head. You could definitely use it for your professional life. I only use it for personal.,5,2020-09-23 08:23:35
Marisa Hannert,"The app is very handy and helpful but the tag ""break"" can't be removed and it occures in every task planned. That makes the good visuals unhelpful and confusing. If that would work 5 stars.",5,2020-08-17 21:03:19

Charlie Severson,"I've only had this app for a week and I love it! My only complaint is one small glitch. When I have routines scheduled in the programmer, some of them show a random tag that's not part of the routine at 12am on each of those dates in the itinerary and widget only, but when I click to edit it, that tag is not actually in the routine. Also, one suggestion for the future: create a feature that allows you to set a whole day back or forward in the number of minutes desired.",5,2019-02-09 19:27:53
Savannah Balisteri,"This app is amazing! It's very user friendly and easy to plan out your day/week. For people who identify as planners, it might be a little addicting,. Being able to make routines for as far in advance as you can imagine, and just turn on that routine when you need it, while having different ones waiting or running is amazing! I just wish that there was a desktop version, or even just a website access point. Hopefully that comes soon!",5,2019-01-07 19:05:38

Alexis Cutshall,"I seriously love this app. Being an extremely forgetful perfectionist is a frustrating oxymoron, but this app is an awesome solution.

The interface is also very slick and aesthetically pleasing. Thank you for this app!",5,2018-09-17 00:33:13
Nezih Kanbur,"I like the program a lot. It helps you realize how much time is wasted during the day, how long routine tasks actually take. One thing I want to warn you about: I added daily wakeup time as a reminder -I think- not definitely sure. It is recorded in standard Android calendar. I re-installed the OS, now I can't delete 365 x reminders for daily wake up time. I'm still searching for a way.",5,2019-05-06 06:33:42

App allows flexible creation of a regular schedule on either a weekly or fortnightly basis but allows special events, reminders and even little notes on the schedule.

Philip Williams,"I deleted my original review, but still highly recommend this app and loving it still... at this rate I doubt I'll ever change to a different app... I've tried other apps too but this one gave me a lot of room for customization while keeping the UI simple to understand... often a difficult balance to keep. I bought the pro version as well and consider it well worth the investment, especially after familiarizing myself with it as much as I have.",5,2019-08-05 02:16:45
Seaney shell,"Edit : Love the app fantastic way to set aside time for what you really should be doing and the notification setter is fairly robust. one thing to mention is that if you don't turn on pop up then you will have to actually click the the notification in notification center. I don't really clear my notifications ever so I had to force stop the app a few times, but after contacting support they help me figure out what I was doing wrong.",5,2019-01-14 22:10:22
George Wrightson,"I have never written a review for an app before but I feel I want to give my feedback to the developers of TimeTune and for anyone considering downloading it for a routine planner. I have never been so impressed by an app. It works so smoothly, the UI is amazing. The customisation options are great. The style/design. The statistics presented to you so you can analyse and change things around in your routine is just a phenomenally useful and an ingenious idea to have there. Everything is just easy and works. I was so impressed when I was setting up my routine, my life, it was like a dream to work with. I cannot recommend this app enough. The developers seem to have delved in to my brain and pulled out exactly the kind of thing that I have always searched for all my life. I can finally say goodbye to the days of trying to organise my life with Excel spreadsheets or having a mini breakdown trying to edit routines on Google calendar without a headache and finally giving up. With TimeTune the details, the functionality, the style, everything, down to the great widget customisation, just... simple, elegant, intuitive, perfect. To the guys/gals who have made this, wherever you are, I shake your hand. Well done on making such an amazing product. All the best for the future - you're going places. As for this app - don't change things too much!!! Tl;dr Everybody should have this app.",5,2018-09-12 20:13:51

zonnovate,"I only recently downloaded this app with the hope to plan out my weekly schedule. Very quickly I realised this was a very well built app having both excellent user experince and user interface. Very happy. My feedback: 1. Add the option to ""Complete"" an activity, at the moment I need to add a custom made ""Completed"" tag each time. Asana does a good job at this. 2. Add a colour wheel to give full customization, would love this. 3. Not enough icons, possibly from add free icon libraries?",5,2020-12-25 00:29:04
Emily Rocha,It's hard for me to find a scheduling app that I stick to as a person with terrible ADHD. Time tune has always been consistently the app that keeps me the most in focus.

Not sure I will take the time to redo it although I really did like it. If you do use it, just make sure you back up your schedule!! Edit: Had to just suck it up and redo my schedule.

Nowadays I have plenty of time during the day unlike the past when I was stressed because I didn't know where my time was going. Now, a feature that would make this a super app is an option to send time blocks to 'accomplished list' so that every time a user accomplishes a task they had set for the day they can send it to that list. People get a greater sense of satisfaction when they can see a checklist of what they have accomplished over a period of time. Please make it happen!",5,2020-11-09 16:59:23

Dorothy patch,Very upset that I could not get my password to work or even get any way of communicating this issue with this company. Would love this app otherwise. There is no way of contacting them. Sad was so interested in this planning app.,1,2020-12-27 02:43:29

NICOLE BOTTAR-DILLEN,I didn't realize you had to pay to use it very sad was really excited wish there was a free option,1,2020-12-03 14:23:32
Emma Swift,Very glitchy. Recurring events don't work properly and I constantly get error messages. Not user friendly and no features that are worth the money.,1,2020-12-03 07:50:52
Diana Plopa,"I tried this with my Android tablet, but the screen wouldn't rotate to landscape view; which made the text far too small to work with well. I unsubscribed based on this one lacking feature.",1,2020-11-18 19:00:56

Kimberly Reeder,Thiefs!! I cancelled last year after my free trial and they still took $35.00 and refused to refund my money. I verified it was cancelled and woke up this morning to them stealing another $35.00. I don't even use their crappy product!!!!!! OH AND THERE IS NO WAY BESIDES E-MAIL TO GET AHOLD OF THEM!!,1,2020-09-25 14:33:40
Leanne Wilkinson,Downloaded free trial and looked at it first day and it wasn't really easy to use so didn't look at it again. I had no correspondence from them to tell me that the trial was over and that they were going to take the money. I find that deceptive behaviour as they are banking o people forgetting to cancel.,1,2020-09-08 08:18:15
Christine Carty,Although its.pretty I did not use it so cancelled the subscription. They have billed me again for this even though cancelled through their service and following their instructions on how to do it so ensure you use a payment method they can't override.,1,2020-09-06 11:14:48
Manuela Flores,"Deceiving little app! Nowhere in your app or YouTube commercial did it state that for the first 2 week trial, that you needed a credit card on file.

Jennifer Counts,"I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you.

Amanda C,"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed...",1,2020-01-29 02:33:04

Gina Stone,"I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills.",1,2019-11-26 14:30:48

I love the colours and writing but functionally it is a bit sluggish for the price. I am still considering continuing once the trial is over but not sure.,3,2020-07-02 22:09:48
natalie heck,"I'd give it a 5 if it had some additional features like the ability to search your notes by hashtags or keywords. Also; it works with my Note 8 but writing on the screen is a little clunky, it could be easier to write on screen.",3,2020-06-18 21:28:33
Kimberly McCoy,So far I love the layout and look... I'm not giving it 5 yet but will update as I use it more... I don't like that if I click on my notification that it opens the event to save or delete I stead of just looking at it or giving me the option to complete. My other issue is not being able to change the time I want an all day reminder. Again I love it so far but would like to see that changed.,3,2020-06-09 18:00:03
Jennifer Castillo,why can't i get it to open up on my chromebook? it stays in a phone format...so disappointed,3,2020-05-30 04:28:09
Chrissie Heavey,"The app needs reminders for appointments. I like the stickers, but need more variety.",3,2020-05-21 02:29:45
Cayli Hart,It needs the ability to put stickers on the priorities and tasks. Also needs push notifications for reminders of events. It's essentially just a pretty google calendar with less customization and automatic features.,3,2020-05-19 16:10:04
Althea Buitendag Du Plooy,🌷🌷🌷 I'm used to Goodnote best app Ever. ArtAgenda is 3 star for me. can be better but not worth paying R580 a year. is too much..😱,3,2020-05-18 16:47:18
Lauren Reese,"I'm really glad someone is making an app like this, but it feels like a very early version and it makes more sense to have a kickstarter instead of subscription if you need the cash for primary development. Loads more customization is needed, including a) allowing uploads for your own artwork for cover/theme b) ability to add/delete the modules you need (delete at least - I don't track water so it's a waste for me) and c) landscape mode. I plan to follow development though and good luck!",3,2020-04-24 04:11:05
Lou E,"Downloaded it because I love that it has a weekly, monthly and daily goal views, also lists and water intake goals but it doesn't have push notifications and it seems like I can't cross off events, only goals or tasks and that's a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen",3,2020-04-07 22:50:46
Crystal Gonzalez,It would be good if it was a free app. I understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free.,3,2020-02-23 01:37:52
planning awesome,"I just got this app about 2 days ago. I love it! I would give it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ... if the developers added new features such as: *more affordable $20/year *more stickers: love variety *journaling pages : customizable to be added anywhere within the planner *fully customizable upcoming event pages: to help plan for weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, graduations, parent to be planning & baby or adopted child showers, Valentine's, marriage proposal 😊",3,2020-02-16 11:10:42
Anna Reed,"Great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy. Sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address. Also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map, i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to ""build my desired layout ,more themes and stickers",3,2020-02-08 15:24:53

Patricia Boland,I like this better then the calendar that comes on my phone but it's too pricey. I dont mind paying for an app I like or paying for the downloads I want in an app but you cant justify this price for what you get.,3,2019-11-03 15:23:57

Pamela L,"Never thought I'd go digital for a planner. I was a diehard pencil to paper kind of gal. However, the thing was never with me when I needed it. I'm not carrying it around with me like I do my phone. I'm a home health speech therapist and when COVID hit, I needed to minimize the amount of things I brought into my patients' homes which started my search for the convenience of a digital planner with all the customization of a paper planner. It has absolutely everything I want: - month, week, and day views with hourly breakdown (week and day) - repeating tasks so I don't have to write the same thing over and over - unlimited notes/lists - syncs across devices. I have it on my phone and computer. Best of all, I have it on my work tablet. No more accidently double booking speech sessions! I'm also a hippie and don't think this gets enough love for it's ecofriendly features. - it's all digital = no trash going to landfill - easy color coding = no more multiple plastic pens or washi tape (less clutter in the office/supply bag) - no more physical stickers - multiple covers you can change anytime And it's just so stinking cute!",5,2020-12-01 03:53:29

It takes any calendar - google, outlook, etc, and makes it pretty, and fun so that you actually want to look it and use it. LOVE the lists and how they integrate as tasks to check off on days you assign that they're due.

sandra mallen-moore,"I went ahead with the two week trial. Here's what persuaded me to do the trial: No rewriting - events and tasks can be synced across the calendar, web and mobile, works well with android, syncing across all devices, stability, syncs with Google and Outlook, task management, different fonts and formatting, layout - monthly, weekly and daily, colour coding, choice of covers, good support - takes on board problems and improvements from users input.

Alisha Johnson,"Best planning app out there. Easy to use, highly customizable, excellent customer service. I actually use this every single day. The best part is that the developers listen to and implement feedback, very involved. And, a HUGE shout out for the fact that they focused on Android over Apple.

I also schedule things for my boyfriend & I can merge his calendar so I can get things on to his via email. Also the add-ons SUCH A SLAMIN DEAL! Think about $1 for sticker packet vs $20 (minimum) for a booklet that you won't use even 75% of them the best part?

There is a Facebook group associated with the app which is always full of great tips and inspiration. The creators of the app are very responsive to feedback and are always taking suggestions on how to make the app better. The annual price is about on par with what you might pay for a paper planner so I think it's a good value. And you can use it across multiple devices.,5,2020-12-01 12:05:45

It takes any calendar - google, outlook, etc, and makes it pretty, and fun so that you actually want to look it and use it. LOVE the lists and how they integrate as tasks to check off on days you assign that they're due. What's most impressive though is that the company is always listening to the users, fixing bugs, offering help so it can be used to it's full potential, and making improvements and updates based on our suggestions",5,2020-12-01 10:23:54

Pamela L,"Never thought I'd go digital for a planner. I was a diehard pencil to paper kind of gal. However, the thing was never with me when I needed it. I'm not carrying it around with me like I do my phone. I'm a home health speech therapist and when COVID hit, I needed to minimize the amount of things I brought into my patients' homes which started my search for the convenience of a digital planner with all the customization of a paper planner. It has absolutely everything I want: - month, week, and day views with hourly breakdown (week and day) - repeating tasks so I don't have to write the same thing over and over - unlimited notes/lists - syncs across devices. I have it on my phone and computer. Best of all, I have it on my work tablet. No more accidently double booking speech sessions! I'm also a hippie and don't think this gets enough love for it's ecofriendly features. - it's all digital = no trash going to landfill - easy color coding = no more multiple plastic pens or washi tape (less clutter in the office/supply bag) - no more physical stickers - multiple covers you can change anytime And it's just so stinking cute!",5,2020-12-01 03:53:29
Mandi McIntosh,Really enjoying using this planner and now my lists and tasks can repeat it is slowly replacing my old calendar and to-do apps altogether. Updating to 5 stars now that tasks roll-over when I didn't do them. Fantastic :),5,2020-12-01 03:41:22

Katie Martinez,"I've been nothing but impressed with Artful Agenda. Is it perfect? No, not necessarily. But the amount of updates and new features that have come out in the short time that I have been using it, is amazing. The sync between GCal and AA is quick and easy. in addition to the app, it is also accessible on your desktop, which is where I spend my work days. Love that is all syncs across. The visualization of your calendar and events is flexible and allows for hex color values so you can use the precise colors you want. I really like the sticker sets and the vast majority are free. I've purchased a few additional packs. They are only $1-$2. Super well worth it. I absolutely recommend this app.",5,2020-11-30 23:15:11

Michelle Langley,"I installed this app simply to write the developer. Don't u think it's a bit unfair, beside being extremely rude, to write responses to reviews to people in such a demeaning way? People don't know that ""tasks"" is a hobby project of yours. They simply know it's a feature of the app, but it doesn't work. They likely don't even know or understand the battery issue (hence the link to help them fix it). Don't you think it might be a more productive AND PROFITABLE for u to be helpful instd of rude?",1,2021-01-11 17:02:57
Charles Bellgraph,"Lost two of my lists and cant seem to get them back ... annoyed. Response to their comment ... well ... two different lists were lost and can't seem to be retrieved.

Dan Tay,"Bad idea to change the game rules while in the game: the game is, as long as this was a free app with the critical feature of allowing local backups (the json file), you don't sneakily remove that with an update (v. 1.3 still worked, I didn't had automatic update on)! Yes I know there is the donation option, but because you didn't warn me before update, you only deserve one star, and I will manually copy almost 400 entries to another app.",1,2020-12-03 00:42:59

Nick Kavanagh,"Terrible experience. If you forget to acknowledge a recurring task when it reminds you, it will no longer send reminders for that task. Randomly changes ""remind me when due"" selection to ""do not remind me"". In one week, with 4 tasks per day, it has failed to remind me 9 times. Absolutely useless!

Traci Stetler,"**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.",1,2020-04-09 21:21:33
Depoit T,"I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.",1,2019-11-17 17:02:42

Mark Leveson,I'm struggling with this app. I'm trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that I want it to do that it doesn't seem to be able to do. 1: It doesn't seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day. Instead I seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that I would have alarms going off all day. That would drive me insane! 2: It isn't possible to contact the developer through the app. Quite bizarre!,1,2020-06-08 21:00:00

I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.",1,2020-04-09 21:21:33

I understand syncing is a premium feature, but the backup feature is not and I wish I hadn't bothered with this app in the first place. Edit: In response to your comment, my problem isn't the fact that I want premium features for free, it is the fact that I downloaded this app knowing that it had a free backup feature built-in, which is the main reason I chose this app. Your response shows a lack of professionalism, and frankly, maturity. The premium features do not include a back-up feature, but rather a syncing feature, which doesn't suit my needs. Your app is not the value of a free coffee. The premium features cost $20.99 for a subscription, not a one-time fee. The app accepts donations, but it's also for profit. The description of the app and it's features are misleading, and this is why I am giving you a negative review.",2,2020-08-14 19:07:28

I understand syncing is a premium feature, but the backup feature is not and I wish I hadn't bothered with this app in the first place. Edit: In response to your comment, my problem isn't the fact that I want premium features for free, it is the fact that I downloaded this app knowing that it had a free backup feature built-in, which is the main reason I chose this app. Your response shows a lack of professionalism, and frankly, maturity. The premium features do not include a back-up feature, but rather a syncing feature, which doesn't suit my needs. Your app is not the value of a free coffee. The premium features cost $20.99 for a subscription, not a one-time fee. The app accepts donations, but it's also for profit. The description of the app and it's features are misleading, and this is why I am giving you a negative review.",2,2020-08-14 19:07:28

Sándor-István Magdó,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",3,2020-03-13 12:36:09

Sándor-István Magdó,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",3,2020-03-13 12:36:09

Cheeriness B,"amazing app! the fact that they provide so much flexibility on using subtasks is beyond my expectations. however,it lacks of personally the most important part of a task app; widget. dont get me wrong, i know there's the option for it, but everytime i try to put more than one, it kept showing the same task (i had a lot of tasks to put on my screen, so it was somewhat frustrating that i have to open the app to see the list). i hope they can add option to choose the task we want to display thx",4,2020-10-12 20:34:17

Mat André,"This app is fantastic!! It's simple, but extremely deep, allowing you to add quick tasks in an instant, but also categorize (and sub-categorize), customize, prioritize, and organize all your tasks in almost any way you want. You can set notifications, reminders, etc. I really love the filtered lists (eg. only high priority tasks due in 7 days or less), and subtasks are awesome! It would be nice to be able to have individual due dates for subtasks and the recurring tasks process is a wee clunky..",4,2020-10-06 07:16:00

Ricardo Ribeiro,"Great app but there is still for improvment until reaches the standards of the beloved Wunderlist. Edit as answer: there is nothing wrong with the app, but once one could use Wunderlist, well, that is a 5 stars. Hard to reach it. The most important thing is well out of reach for a personal project: the web interface and the multiplatform concept. Certainly other details, but as you know Wunderlist is deceased so I can't go back and make a side by side comparison. Note that I don't do the silly thing of rate what I don't like with 1 and what I like with 5. Between 1 and 5 there is the 2,3 and 4 and they should be used. A four is a very good rate. A 5 is for something which is truly unbeatable, unique, the best.",4,2020-08-05 17:22:42
Jennifer MF,"Great app for writing down things you need to do and stay organized. Love how I can put the widget on the home screen and use it from there.

Juan Gutierrez,"This app is perfect for my needs but there is one issue that I just noticed on repeated tasks. Once you hit complete the task, it will not add automaticly the next task.

Jamie Morvitz,I like that I can make different lists and sublists of tasks and it's easy to move something from one list to another or cross something off. The one thing it's missing is that if I have a list called Today and one called Tomorrow it doesn't automatically change where the tasks are. Like if I have a task on Today and don't get to do it I'd love for it to show up in my Tomorrow list tomorrow. Otherwise it's easy to use and I also love that there is a place to put notes for each task item.,4,2020-07-27 21:39:22

Ryan Peterson,"I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.",4,2020-09-12 01:20:10
Evelyn,Really useful app! It does the job well. I like the customisation of colours and stuff.

Veronica Huber,"This is organized and easy to use. You can make the lists as detailed or simple as you want. Unfortunately, it's not very visually pleasing.

Nitsan Simantov,One of the best ones. Neat organisation and very easy to use. I love the subcategories.

Stopped using Google Assistant for my reminders because half the time I wasn't getting them but this app has given me every reminder and no issues whatsoever. I use this app for so many things and even my family's wish lists are neatly organized. Great app even if you don't upgrade it but I'm glad I did. Life saver for this mom!,5,2021-01-09 18:55:58

It's up to you",5,2021-01-02 09:44:14
Cam Crea,"Very effective app for managing my full scope of tasks/objectives. The app has a nice variety of features to cater to user preferences for organizing action items - e.g. filtered lists, tags, a calendar view of tasks, etc. One of my favorite features is the ability to set recurrences in various increments, e.g. by minutes, hours, days, etc - e.g. I may need a reminder every 15 minutes for a period of time - this app let's me do that!

I really need to upgrade to premium, the price is reasonable.",5,2020-11-18 08:27:52
Ian Hinton,"Absolutely top-notch! After trying out several applications to manage my tasks, I found the ideal fit: simple and powerful. It's great to have a free app without publicity, but I believe that quality software such as this deserves remuneration. That's why I signed up for the Premium version, even though I didn't need any more features. What I needed was already packed into the free version. Great application Stephen. Keep up the good work! ***Update: I'm thrilled to see some of the new features that are being incorporated. This app was really good when I installed it 11 months ago, and is still getting better. It's a MUST for anybody looking for a simple-to-use but powerful agenda/time management system. This one is way ahead of any of the dozen or so apps I've tried in recent years.",5,2020-12-08 11:00:26

Alexandre Deedler,"I have found this app very useful in the past. The functionalities are solid, unbloated, the environment is minimalist and the widgets work. However, at some point I stopped using it for an extended period and never came back. I think that one of the reasons for this is because of how bothersome I find it to be to heavily use my phone as an interface. I just realized that this app has a paying premium version for $16/y which offers a regular web interface, which would be ideal for me. The problems are, however, that the premium features are very poorly marketed, even on the app's official web page; and I am not ready to put down $16/y on a feature for which I can't evaluate its implementation beforehand. Secondly, my phone operator used to support Google Pay, but no longer; I couldn't even buy it if I wanted to :-(. Hence, other 3rd party payment methods would be welcome as well.",5,2020-11-07 18:02:36
E A,"I love it! I have tried so many organization/list apps. They were either too complex and too detailed with tasks that I don't need, or they were too open and left up to you to create everything with no real format. This is perfect.

Create lists with subtasks, rearrange as needed, set reminders, take notes, move tasks between lists, etc I downloaded this app because I saw that the developer responded to a user's suggestion in another review. Fantastic!",5,2020-12-12 19:14:46
Madhu A,"Question: I am paying for premium subscription but unsure how to login in to the Webapp? The login page on webapp seems to be just redirecting. NVM, I figured it out. Syncing once on the Android app, automatically logged me in to the Web app on the computer as well. Original review: I love the widget in this app and the ability to organize notes in folders (aka Microsoft).

Aleik 85,"Edited from 4* to 5*, small problem below resolved immediately by developer. Really good app, thank you. There's one thing that happens I can't get rid of though. Sometimes when I check off a recurring task (say daily, and checking off on the 12th), I'll reopen the app on the 13th and the task will be in red, unchecked and still due on the 12th. I've just updated. Is this one of the bugs you've fixed? Thanks",5,2020-12-05 10:05:27
Calia Hardy,It's a good app it's a check list and you can make different columns for different things. It does what it says. However it would be even better if I could be able to see all the tasks I did a day before or the tasks I want to have planned for tommorow. But other than that it's really good would recommend if you need something simple,5,2020-11-30 21:49:03
Tapasya Marathe,"Amazing app. After installing 5-6 todo apps,this wins and stays (beats the popular ones) due to its simplicity. Realy beautifully simple ONE SOLUTION to all my needs - daily routine , shopping list , braindump etc Liked it's customisation ,looks so sweet on my homescreen when it gels in with the background colour. So many colours, font sizes ,transparency. Love the fact that it notes the time when task is completed. helps me in my time tracking and planning Good work Stephen 👍",5,2020-11-23 15:53:48
Brianna Bojewski,"I love this app! It has really helped me stay organized and on top my my daily routines. I really enjoy the ability to check things off when they are done, makes me feel accomplished! The format and deisgn is lovely as well. It's nice to be able to change the colors of different lists or reminders.",5,2020-12-03 04:22:06
A Google user,"Great app. Really easy to use and has all the features I need. No unrelated permissions required. No ads. Best part is it continues to work on older phones, very happy with it on Android 4.4.2. Clean interface with easy and clear navigation. Lots of options in Settings to make the app work as I need it to. Brilliant.",5,2020-12-09 00:19:40
PETER WATTS,I just need a straightforward list of things to do which is simple and clear. I had a look at lots of others before I started with Tasks. A few more display options eg colours would be nice but can live without them This year I bought the Premium version for the sync feature but for the life of me I can't see how it works so won't bother next year,5,2020-12-09 17:23:37
Lynn Brau,I love this app! I use this for my grocery list and many other lists. I love the way you can list your tasks and subtasks. I really like that you and easily rearrange the list. I also like how you can set yourself a reminder notification. I inadvertently changed a setting so I contacted the creator and got an answer right away! I am very satisfied!,5,2020-10-30 18:28:15
Stefan Monov,"The app is very versatile - doesn't force me into any particular way of using it. It's so well done that I'm using it even for my non-""TODO"" notes. I've dropped specialized notetaking apps like Google Keep and Evernote because ""Tasks"" is better. The ""quick add"" feature is surprisingly useful. The author is responsive and polite. And, he has never made any changes of the type that might break my habitual workflow. There are a few bugs on my specific second-hand device, but none of them are dealbreakers.",5,2020-12-09 12:30:47
Samuel Blackett,"I have a disability affecting memory and organisation, and this app is almost perfect for planning my day. The only thing that could improve it would be a second layer of nesting for subtasks e.g. ""kitchen"" as a subtask of ""clean house"" and ""empty bin"" as a subtask of ""kitchen"". Lists of subtasks can get very long, messy, and overwhelming when everything has to fit into one layer. I would upgrade to premium if it provided this feature but 5 stars regardless as I am using this app for free.",5,2020-11-06 00:34:17
Mohit Prakash,I will have to say that this is the best app out there regarding To do lists and remainders.,5,2021-01-05 10:42:26
Steve Smith,I use this for work everyday. I have tried several task apps before this one and none compare. Love this app. The detailed features and ability to organize my daily inpections has made keeping track of all that i do so much easier. Thank you!,5,2020-12-18 13:22:34
Adam Clements,"I don't often bother reviewing apps, but I really like this a lot. A to-do list should be a simple thing but it's amazing how many people make bad ones. This is by far the best I've used - has a lot of good functionality but not too much, and is user friendly and has some character without being annoying! 5/5* 💯",5,2020-11-26 11:20:04
marky b,"Simple, Powerful and Easy to use app. I've scoured for years to finally find this app. I don't use todo lists like they are meant to be used. Its more a notes list with the option to diarise/notify me when certain jobs I need to do. Its also used to keep track of day to day work as my job is very sporadic. Only niggle is it's not listed to be able to send notifications to my Fitbit which would be really handy. That said, I very rarely donate/buy, yet I've donated as my search is finally over!",5,2020-12-05 21:00:03
toni aritonov,"This app is the best thing ever First i had the task list from 2010 and i was organising my life and my work,and i thought it was the best,until the new updates and i could not use it anymore and i was so sad But now i found Tasks, which is 10 time better,and i am only 4 hous on it. Thanks again for the creator and the team Great work",5,2020-12-20 17:45:32
Gary Reed,"Great app. Would like to be able to have task audio notifications that repeat, say every 10 minutes, until the task is marked as completd. I just upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars. The developer took the time to promptly explain to me how to use the functionality that I thought was missing. Thank you!",5,2020-11-13 19:35:55

Ahmad Jamal,"This is one of the best checklist & reminder app I have ever used. The only one very important missing feature is to backup automatically to cloud (what if I lost my phone!). Thank you so much Stephen. I am sending a backups via email weekly. consider adding a automatic backups will save my time. **UPDATE** Since my review last year until now and Stephen is doing great job and more improvements. Now my tasks and reminders are safe with backup feature. one last thing I wish, 📢 ATTACHMENTS.",5,2020-11-01 23:58:59
Dan Belisle,Switched recently to this App. Very pleased with the features offered. The app is pretty easy to learn and I have observed many nice features.  It is a great product and I will be using it regularly. The FAQ and tech notes are also useful. Author provided quick response to my few questions. Thank-you for all your efforts to produce and maintain.,5,2020-11-22 17:22:59
Julie Offen,"I use this app on a daily basis to keep myself organized and on track. I keep a shopping list that i clear out as i put items in my cart, a to do list, packing lists for travel.. I even keep my Xmas card list in the app! So handy. I recommend it to anyone i know looking for a simple tool to replace paper.",5,2020-12-13 14:25:38

Your Loneliness,"The more I discover, the better it gets. Love the layout, love the options, love the ease of use. I feel like a thief for not donating or paying for the premium, maybe if I feel like I need extra features but so far, all good. 😊 Good job",5,2020-12-02 21:32:23
L C,"Such an amazing app, even the free version! Beautiful and flexible but still simple to use. Great customisation and organisation tools like priority setting, different lists, notes and deadlines! I went to purchase the pro version to support the developer as I like the app so much but unfortunately it's only subscription. Instead I donated using the built in donate function to show my support! Thanks for the great app 😁",5,2020-12-10 10:12:38
Carlie Finai,"Pretty good, allows me to check off items as I go instead of just deleting them",5,2021-01-09 05:17:15
Crew Jones,"I stumbled upon this app when my built in reminder app stopped allowing me to set reminders (ironically). It's nice and orderly and helps me stay on track. Thank you developers for this wonderfully product! When I get a job, I plan to go premium.",5,2020-12-17 04:31:16
Sharon Jonas,"Great app!! Tried several others but this is the best one I've found, no adds and very functional without having to buy premium. Love that you can add sub tasks and even notes to each task.",5,2020-12-16 23:44:17
Charles Stephens,This app is user friendly and allows great visuals with priorities by using assorted colors. The premium cost is perfect and well worth the added benefits to keep one list no matter if it is my work or personal cell. The ease to link it to my outlook is much simpler than using google voice commands.,5,2020-12-14 15:03:20
DerpGnome,"I am extremely happy with this app (and I'm usually not thát enthusiastic in my reviews)! I don't need the options of the premium version, but if I ever do, I'd be willing to pay for it. Edit: the new update is worth 6 stars. I have some serious planning issues and it helps me on a day to day basis.",5,2020-12-07 06:14:00
Maria Mourkou,"Since I downloaded this app, I never bothered using others. It's simple, easy to use and really helps me to stay organised. The interface is friendly for users and it doesn't feel overbearing, which helps me to cope with my anxiety and procrastination.",5,2020-11-12 00:09:49
Aleksandr Makarenkov,"Very nice todo list but any reminders didn't work for me. When i try to save new date or time for reminder, or choose ""every day"" and press ""save"" - it says that all saved but when i return to reminder screen - all settings are dropped to defaults. Update: oh, never mind, I'm silly, - i just created many new events in calendar, everything fine now",5,2020-11-05 15:55:51
Melinda Casalicchio,Used for just a few days. So far so good and wonderful to have absolutely no ads. Can you please add a DUE TODAY feature which also shows in the phone's notification screen to win the 5th star. That for me would clinch it. Thank you. Thanks Steve. Very happy bunny,5,2020-12-13 21:32:15

Jennifer Cluse,"For decades air traffic controllers used a simple rearwards leaning vertical u-rack into which small wide carriers could be stacked, one above the other. As a new task (aircraft) arrived in the controller's sector, a paper 'strip' with the flights details was slipped into a carrier, one strip per aircraft, in what formed task flow sequence, priority aircraft by ETA placed at the top of the stack. I tried to do one in code, but was beaten. This code does this solution to perfection. Brilliant.",5,2020-12-14 00:34:21

Louise Marr,"Edit: changed to 5 stars after contacting the developer I realised that there were so many more options to customise the app to display & function to suit me, I expected the system settings to only have a few basic options but there's masses of customisable settings which make the app even more helpful & brilliant to use. Highly recommend this app! Great app, simple & efficient. The subtasks feature really helps me feel I've achieved something when I can tick off a small part of a bigger job.",5,2020-10-29 22:37:43
Chelsea Diggs,Absolutely LOVE this app!!! You don't have to buy premium to enjoy it either so it's so great for us hopeless debtors who need to stay on track with all the chaos 7/5 stars 👍 God bless 🙏,5,2020-12-29 21:15:18

Also Steve must work 24 hours a day every time I had a question he got back to me right away. Again thanks for all your help! I like everything about Task app with all the sorting capabilities etc. but if if could only get it to sync with my computer like google keep works. Thanks in advance for your help!

Rob F,"Great, except... it has a serious (and unpredictable) problem displaying recurring events that recur on more than 1 day/week from both from Google/Outlook calendars. The events DO show on the Android Google or Outlook calendar apps, so it's NOT an Android sync issue as suggested in another response. Reiterating this point. The calendars ARE synced corrected on Android, just not always displayed in BC2. Single events and single day/week recurring events seem ok, but multiple day/week events are *unpredictably* displayed in BC2. Same behaviour on multiple devices.",1,2021-01-14 16:13:41
Michael Hardman,Was once a great app. They made a change about a year ago that causes assigned task times to change when changing time zones. Example: I create a task to occur at 9 a.m. EST (which would be 8 a.m. CST) when I travel to the Central Time zone the task time physically changed to 9 a.m. CST (which is 10 a.m. EST...not the same thing of course). So then the task occurs (and notifies) an hour late. I've tried to get them to fix it through support for the last year. They don't seem to be interested.,1,2020-12-15 20:36:53

Ooma Chasooma,"Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates.

Alin Posorovaschi,"Ads that cover the whole screen [Later update] Since you bothered to respond to my review I will elaborate: 1. Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google. The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a ""Business Calendar"" app that sends me adds about online games that I can ""skip"" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either. We want stable things that we don't need to upgrade every week or so. 4. Since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed I realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices... And they don't have any adds.",1,2020-06-26 11:47:00
A Google user,Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.,1,2020-02-13 12:16:19
Matthew Scott,Used this calendar for years without any issue. Now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out. Terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers. They've lost me as a user as I refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The ads suck and are annoying.,1,2020-02-08 03:28:42
Charles Roberts,"Its a great app I used for years. I was ok with ads, but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable. When I need Calendar info, I need it RIGHT NOW. I'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads I'm out. Edit post response: I'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version, because it is better than stock Calendar. But its not 7 bucks better. So if you're not going to remove full screen ads, after years of using, gotta say buh bye...",1,2020-02-20 02:29:49

You can't skip them until it's done. This app is now hot garbage. I don't mind ads, they need to make money but 30 second ads about making a social media account, or jump scare ads, or straight up scams is invasive and abhorrent.

Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.,1,2020-05-07 09:25:51

Jayendran Ramani,"Purchased, but a disappointment. After phone boot, the widget is all black until it completely loads; and is annoying!

James Calcote,"Ads that completely take over your phone & have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them. - EDIT - It's untrue what the developer says regarding ads appearing once every 18 hours, it is more frequent.

Alin Posorovaschi,"Ads that cover the whole screen [Later update] Since you bothered to respond to my review I will elaborate: 1. Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google. The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a ""Business Calendar"" app that sends me adds about online games that I can ""skip"" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either. We want stable things that we don't need to upgrade every week or so. 4. Since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed I realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices... And they don't have any adds.",1,2020-06-26 11:47:00

Their comment doesn't show up in the edit pop up so I'm not sure where it will be when I submit this. I have been using Business Calendar since I got my original Droid about a decade ago. Once I decided that I liked the way that it worked, I paid for the pro upgrade. When Business Calendar 2 came out I installed it along side Business Calendar Pro to keep the pro features without an additional payment. I also installed both programs on an Android Tablet. Everything synced with Google Calendar and tasks showed up on both devices. The only issue was that if you entered a repeating task on one device and marked it complete on the other the repetitive task was not created. I realise that this is a Google problem, but you could probably pass this information in the description field if you wanted an enhancement. I recently got a new phone. That is when the tasks quit syncing. I think that a newer version of the apps were installed on the phone than I had been using. I also upgraded the apps on the tablet to see if that would fix the problem. I have just uninstalled the apps from both devices, deleted the tasks from Google Calendar in a web browser, and reinstalled the apps on both devices.

Mark Rollins III,"Checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single, scrollable homescreen widget. --- Unfortunately, although the app has the option to repeat a task ""from the completion date,"" the functionality is broken.  For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the ""Thursday"" and the ""from completion date."" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work.",2,2018-10-28 12:15:55

Theta Sigma,"This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted.

Haani Ja'waan,"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!",2,2018-12-01 02:40:34
Emil Partington,"The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place.",2,2020-01-25 09:58:34

The biggest bug being adding in birthdays or anything that has a date, as instead of putting the date I requested it will put it a day behind or a day beforehand.",2,2020-06-10 04:51:22

It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.,2,2020-05-31 19:38:01

David Hooper,"Tasks are no longer syncing with Google Calendar. Therefore they do not sync between devices. Lowered rating from 5 to 2 stars. I'm trying to respond to the Developer. Their comment doesn't show up in the edit pop up so I'm not sure where it will be when I submit this. I have been using Business Calendar since I got my original Droid about a decade ago. Once I decided that I liked the way that it worked, I paid for the pro upgrade. When Business Calendar 2 came out I installed it along side Business Calendar Pro to keep the pro features without an additional payment. I also installed both programs on an Android Tablet. Everything synced with Google Calendar and tasks showed up on both devices. The only issue was that if you entered a repeating task on one device and marked it complete on the other the repetitive task was not created. I realise that this is a Google problem, but you could probably pass this information in the description field if you wanted an enhancement. I recently got a new phone. That is when the tasks quit syncing. I think that a newer version of the apps were installed on the phone than I had been using. I also upgraded the apps on the tablet to see if that would fix the problem. I have just uninstalled the apps from both devices, deleted the tasks from Google Calendar in a web browser, and reinstalled the apps on both devices.

I will be contacting the developer about these changes today. See what happens.",2,2020-10-25 23:52:07
Jakub Korečko,Generally it's satisfactory calendar app. Variety of features with clean and productive design. The only problem is the support. Recently there are ads quite frequently popping up in the app. When I wanted to upgrade to PRO app shows some technical issue on their side. I tried to contact support but answer was general and didn't solve the problem at all.,2,2020-10-24 21:12:50
Jake Nuno,"Long time paid user, who is very disappointed with the current version. I have had several events and tasks disappear as if they were never created. I have had this happen for months now and have done multiple tests to see if I am at fault, however, this issue happens at random. I have had events refresh then they are gone, nowhere to be seen again, ye the quick text will pop up when I attempted to make a NEW event with the same title, so it was entered in, but nothing showing.

Unfortunately, usability is severely compromised. Busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view. Tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots (10:05 or 14:40).

I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate.

Aaron Misner,"I have been using this app for years, but I am thinking of trying a different app. The issue that I have, is that doing seemingly simple tasks is overly complicated.

Doing so has proven very complex and often I will create a task only to realize it has defaulted to my gmail account rather than the local list I intended.

Clifford B. Brown,"This app is great as far as the calendar and task functions. However, it is nearly unbearable to use since it doesn't respect the phone setting to not notify during a call. When it notifies during a phone call using the regular carrier app (not Skype, Hangouts or other app), it buzzes and sends a loud notification that is painful and very disruptive. I sent in a support request 3.5 years ago and they said it shouldn't do that and they were going to ""look into it."" But they haven't fixed it in any updates and it's been the same on all of the different phones I've had since then, not just an isolated issue on one phone.",3,2019-05-24 15:01:27

A few versions back, app started to drain my battery much faster and about the same time they added a really intrusive advertisement showing ads all the time when using it. I thought I will work through it, but no, it is very annoying, so I must say good-bye. When they stop with those ads, I will be happy to come back, but not like this. EDIT AFTER ANSWER FROM DEVELOPER: It is not true what they write - I get ads all the time, not just every 18 hours - probably because I am not villing to watch them till the end and then they always come back again. Also, skipping them via back button does not work. Very wrong concept of ads handling! No, thanks, already switched to another app.",3,2020-05-07 07:43:53
A Google user,"pretty cool.. its features are much better than the previous version.

(I saw a review from the app developer.. maybe, that problem could have been coming from other sources like my phone or google play app itselft, or the like.. Sorry for the comment that I have left even when I was not sure.. I thought that way because a lot of popups have ben shown when I was using this app.. Sometimes Gallery or Photo app on my phone (my phone is cheap but compact) even sometimes show up ad.. maybe that could be the real cause of the problem..)",3,2018-11-04 11:21:04

hashim wahbi,"Good. Has what you need from a calendar. However, ads are far too frequent, and some ads that you show contain jumpscares which makes me uncomfortable using the app. I know ads are not in your control, but £5.99 is far too expensive to pay for what the pro version actually offers.

All I want to do is search within the current month for a keyword that should be simple to find if I can tell it or set it to search the current month as opposed to random Before and After Time that the app determines.",3,2020-09-28 17:42:27

EDIT AFTER ANSWER FROM DEVELOPER: It is not true what they write - I get ads all the time, not just every 18 hours - probably because I am not villing to watch them till the end and then they always come back again.

Igor,"Just downloaded it, and bought it only to try the multiple-selection feature. I was expecting more actually, hoping to select & move multiple events directly drag'n'dropping from the Week view (when it says ""Tap to select""), from one day to another (I use it for postponing events that need rescheduling). Having to go to a separate (Agenda) view is a little cumbersome and not immediate as drag'n'drop would be (it took 10 minutes to find the multi-select feature, because of my expectations). However it works and it's better than most of the apps I tried have to offer. -- The rest of the app looks good so far, with nice features and good Tasks integration; I also really like the slider to choose the amount of Week days to visualise 👍.

Not linked to multi-accounts, shows all no matter what. Very frustrating. Other than that it's good for quick calendar entries, that's why it's staying. ***edit*** Going to ""settings -> appearance -> filter duplicate events"" gets rid of them.

Currently they all tasks are shown in a single list, including sub-tasks. This soon becomes unmanageable and impossible to see on a single screen. It would be great to have the ability to nest tasks and fold up the sub-tasks so that only the parent is visible.",4,2018-11-06 17:21:03
Robin Gather,"I loved this app, but some update slowed it down tremendously to the point that its becoming unusable. I've tried deleting old tasks and events but it's still lagging all over the place. This saddens me, because this app was my daily driver and I was about to purchase the premium version. but now I'm looking for alternatives. I'm using an LG G6 that runs smoothly. Please try to improve your performance or revert whatever changes were made that impacted it. Thank you.  Edit: I've tried re-installing, clearing cache, checking how much memory is used (I have 4 gigs and this app's usage is negligible). The lagging started happening after I updated the app. I've now downloaded an older version APK from December 2018. This version runs smoothly like before the update. I'm not sure which update is the one that made the app unusable, since I skipped a few. My main problem is that on the month view, the scrolling is laggy, adding tasks is laggy, everything is laggy. Also, sometimes, for no reason, tasks copy themselves to a new task that is planned for ""all day"" instead of a specific time. I'll up my review from 3 stars to 4. I might try to update again in a few months.",4,2019-06-26 15:15:13
Marcus Thang,I've had a really good experience with the app (aside from not being able to delete individual events in a repeated series of events) up until yesterday when I clicked on backup in my Xiaomi Red 3S. I've since lost all my tasks/events in the app and can't find my account in the settings which my tasks/events were saved in. This is frustrating as I need to see the line up of events I have for the next few weeks and it's important for me to be able to see what happened in the past too. I would like to have help to find out if in fact I can still retrieve whatever data I had or if somehow I lost them all. Thank you,4,2018-12-14 02:24:04
MyLisa Moses,"I have used this app for years and love it! Giving it 4 stars though because my widgets don't work anymore after the last update.

Igor,"Just downloaded it, and bought it only to try the multiple-selection feature. I was expecting more actually, hoping to select & move multiple events directly drag'n'dropping from the Week view (when it says ""Tap to select""), from one day to another (I use it for postponing events that need rescheduling). Having to go to a separate (Agenda) view is a little cumbersome and not immediate as drag'n'drop would be (it took 10 minutes to find the multi-select feature, because of my expectations). However it works and it's better than most of the apps I tried have to offer. -- The rest of the app looks good so far, with nice features and good Tasks integration; I also really like the slider to choose the amount of Week days to visualise 👍. I will update the review when I will have actually tried it further. -- Btw, I'm in Berlin too; if you need some more developer, I might be interested 😊",4,2020-11-05 13:51:44

Barry Elmi,Good working app,4,2020-10-15 21:16:38
Prita Hasjim,I am a huge fan of Fantastical (on iOS) so I needed an app like it when I got an Android phone. I love the widget and I love the reminders feature! My only critique is I wish there was a simpler view for the monthly view. It's a little overwhelming to see it all the way it is right now. I like Fantastical's monthly view better.,4,2020-10-14 19:32:56
Charles Stuart,"Generally great tool, nicely integrated different calendars",4,2020-10-14 08:54:50
Colin Chee,Perfect - has all the features that I need. Took out 1 star because I can't seem to add Google Meet video to my meetings.,4,2020-10-11 12:32:44
angel Graham,Decent,4,2020-10-09 02:47:47

Stella Sansom,Good but ads for over a minute,4,2020-10-01 22:30:43
Josef H.,"Okay I'm sold, this app has no equal in the Play store and has all the features I always wished for. There are only two things I'm missing: option to remove the Favourite bar (I don't need it at all so it just takes up valuable screen real estate) and an option to change the text colour for the dark theme. It's just too dark. It should be white, not grey.",4,2020-09-30 17:44:45
Sergio Marchetti,Pretty good app,4,2020-09-29 01:28:55
Ting,It will be perfect if could add a button to go back to today on widget,4,2020-09-28 05:42:29
Mahala Valencia,I like this app a lot but still having trouble syncing the app to my phone and my husband's phone.,4,2020-09-27 16:42:54
Doug Blackwell,Solid,4,2020-09-27 15:09:34
Murat Taner,This is a fantastic app. I paid for the pro version after trying for a few weeks. The features are just about right for me. I switched from another paid app that I've been using for over 10 years. 4 stars because: 1. Colors set manually for events/tasks do not carry across devices. 2. Minimum task synch time you can set is one hour.,4,2020-09-27 07:07:49
Karen Stimson,"Love it - wanted an app to combine Apts & Tasks from Google, with good widgets - does that & more❣",4,2020-09-24 12:53:45
Gianluca Pisanello,It's really good. Would get 5th star if it was possible to refresh the widget at set intervals. Also manual refresh of the widget doesn't work. Have to open the app to sync.,4,2020-09-24 12:39:19
takeru the Gadgetster,It would be greater if it can show also Google Reminders integrated.,4,2020-09-24 08:08:02
Ja De,"Its perfect to me!! except, that the postpone button looks exactly like the refresh button... This leads to a lot a lot of confusion. Maybe just replace the postpone icon with a straight arrow-->",4,2020-09-23 11:55:43

Joseph Lye,So far no issues with the app,4,2020-09-18 11:56:20
uchi.verse,"Just WOW! This is by far one of the best, satisfying, thought out App I've ever seen in the PlayStore. It has pretty much all functions that you could imagine wanting to have. Actually it's even more than you can imagine. It's crazy how you can actually customize everything! PS: Me, being secretly proud to be a Berliner and using this app! :D",5,2021-01-08 00:02:46
Brad Osborne,"Useful. I like the layout flexibility and widgets, but mainly use it because of the ability to set up new calendar entry templates. For instance, I automatically include invites to my business and wife's calendars to share awareness of my personal schedule, and this saves time vs manually adding the info to every appointment. I've used this product for many years... Probably more than a decade, and have purchased the paid version. Well worth the investment for me.",5,2020-12-29 18:19:37
Lukasz Toczek,"The app is fantastic overall. I've also set it up on my wives phone and it is vital part of our daily schedule. However, there is one scar on the app which is tasks time. I know that BC allowed setting up time, and this was done only locally, as the google calendar api did not allow for setting up time. However, this changed last year in march and I can very well set the time of the task when creating the task through google app, but this time is not recognized in BC and vice versa. It's been already a year and a half since google introduced this change, but still BC does not recognize the time set via google calendar api. Why?",5,2020-12-18 13:46:02
Y O,"I've used paid version for years and it's been great except for the occasional glitch, usually solved by reinstalling the app. But now an event is suddenly just not showing up. I've checked everything, tried sync, install/uninstall, change color of event, toggle bottom menu tabs, checked which calendar it's on, checked if event shows on google calendar app, etc. But no, the issue is with business cal. I would have completely missed this important event if I hadn't checked my calendar on my laptop. Please fix this, a calendar that skips events is useless.",5,2021-01-04 12:14:13
Rebecca Myers,Love using this app! I love that it can sync multiple google calendars so I can see what everyone in the family is doing. I started with the free version and then upgraded to get more features because I love it. The task bar on the side is a life-saver for me and all my to-do's. I like the reminder and repetition feature of the tasks and calendar. The search feature is wonderful for when I don't want to look day-to-day for an appointment. I've been using this app for years and won't change!,5,2021-01-02 14:13:05
Kevin Humphreys,"I've been using this app for many many years so it's about time I rated and reviewed it. Everything just works: layout options are plenty, integration with any calendar is simple, and not to mention the widgets available! Try it out, and if you're like me you'll end up using it for many years to come.",5,2021-01-05 18:02:22
Dave Kopanic,"I've been using this app for years to manage multiple Google calendars. The app is highly customizable, gives much better control over reminders than the Google Calendar app, and can also access / manage tasks from Google accounts as well. It takes some time to get the settings exactly the way you want them, but the app functionality is well worth the time spent setting it up. Also, the few times I have contacted customer service, they have always been quick to reply and fix issues.",5,2020-12-02 18:37:45
Linda Barclay,"BEST CALENDAR APP EVER and I've tried almost all. Super customizable and easy to figure out from the start. Installed it on my husband's phone and even my husband thinks it's the best and he's a guy guy. For sure 2021 is going to be a great year, make it even better with this app!",5,2020-12-20 15:54:22
Ms.Ntxhi VangYang,I have the purchased version. I love that they have more colors. Love that each event can have a reminder which can be customized. I love that different email calendars can be incorporated into 1 calendar. My husband and I both have the same calendar on our phones and each update on the other's phone appears in the calendar. I have had this app for 3 years. So far so good.,5,2020-12-03 13:43:00
Mr. ??????,"Great app. Couldn't live without it. Best secretary a person could have. I would be list without the day to day reminders. Not to mention monthly, or even yearly. Recommend to anyone that needs to be places on time. Thanks Ed",5,2020-12-20 17:05:27
A Google user,"I've been using this app for ages, from iPhone to Samsung and its awesome. Kept updated, easy to use and most importantly has the ability to show monthly spread with actually readable word descriptions of events, and can change colours of text and events. Thankyou to the creators for making this because I'm missing hardly any appointments now. Edit: still using in Dec 2020!! Going strong, use it with multiple Google calendars and widgets to keep organised, upgraded to pro to show my support.",5,2020-12-10 15:24:26
Daniel Kitura,"I am really pleased with this calendar. It has basically everything you would need (built-in checklists with priorities are really useful, as well as ability to create your own templates). I'm glad to see that developers continue to improve their creation. I think the main thing that is currently missing, is a PC companion app, so that we have one cohesive ecosystem with the same interface, layout and features. I think you get the idea :) So I'm really looking forward to that and wish you luck!",5,2020-12-02 23:18:37
Andree Orange,"I've been a paid user of this app for years now, and I really can only praise it. It always does what it's supposed to do, the UI is gorgeous and clean, and it does help me keep my life super organized. I use this app to Track roughly everything in my life, from social events to birthdays to astronomy movements to health stuff. So many colors can be used to classify that at a glance I can know what happened in a day without even looking into the details. I wouldnt switch for any other app.",5,2020-12-13 08:43:07
Jason Quach,"Update: Bumping it up to 5 stars! I love that it has more features now, such as more colors and Google tasks appear on the calendar too! Previous issues are resolved now. It works well but doesn't always work 100%. I had to update my calendar four times before it actually saved.",5,2020-10-30 17:11:27
Darren Olsen,"Used it for a month or more, has all the extras I need. Agenda, tasks, events, all together and separate. I like you can push things forward on your calendar easily. You can set a time to complete a task so it tells you when its over due. So far so good, best one I have found.",5,2020-10-29 09:32:49
Lisa Coleman,My wait is over !!! Finally a calendar app that makes it easy to sync tasks and events and one that gives time to tasks. So far I love the appearance that I am able to create in the premium/pro version( for one time cost of only $7.49). Also the customer service is amazing . They quick to answer question. LOVE THIS APP!!!!,5,2020-10-30 19:40:25
Tom Williams,"A good a calendar app. Easy to read events even in the month view on my pixel 3 I like that. Still good, and still using the app two years on. Now on a Pixel 5. I have looked at other calendar apps and none works as well as this one. Give it a try. You will like it.",5,2020-12-08 15:29:48
James Martinez,Worth every single penny. When I get an assignment it gets put on this calendar immediately. I add reminders and different colors to the task to set them apart. My current version also has Dark Sky weather as a nice bonus feature.,5,2020-12-16 21:22:36
Glenn Williams,"I love, love, love this Calendar app. It syncs ALL of my Google Calendars along with team members and the company calendar. The features really help me be more productive scheduling and monitoring my time commitments. My favorite feature is the Agenda widget on one of my phone's home screens, because it let's me easily see what I have going on today and for the next 30 days. I set this to only have my personal and family schedule, but can easily click into full program to see all calendars.",5,2020-12-01 13:28:15
Pinkie Vi,"Edit: Applying the settings suggested by the devs everything seems to be working. Thanks! Original: I have issues with what for me is the core of the app: the widget. It stops working when the phone is on a couple of days, dislpaying a random day in the past as ""now"" with none of the UI elements responding. The top right settings for changing settings or adding entries also only work if I had the app opened recently. After rebooting or a couple of hours the phone those buttons don't work [..]",5,2020-12-18 01:02:27
Autumn MoonPetal,"I had to take advice from a friend when it came to needing a more portable agenda to keep me on track. I appreciate this because it has task tracking I can check off and I can schedule what I'm doing in the day to keep track of my time. I love this one by far of all the apps I've tried. There are many more options and customization features for anyone. Not just for business, for life too",5,2020-11-21 05:54:57
Miklós Gerely,I haven't used it for long yet but I like that it can be a widget. I made a full screen daiy view widget and so now I need just scroll my screen there and I can see my schedule. And I like that it has come codes for the calendars.,5,2021-01-04 13:56:48
Connie,"WARNING TO SAMSUNG GALAXY USERS! I love this app. Unfortunately, I just installed the system update from Samsung today and it completely wiped out EVERYTHING on this calendar and the calendar on my phone. I don't know how to fix this, hopefully customer support on this site will be able to help me.",5,2020-10-26 04:48:32
Greg Ojeda,"Great app, works well. One suggestion is for the icon to open the app on my homescreen should display the current day of the month as I've seen on other calendar apps. Yours doesn't do this, and shouldn't be that difficult to do.",5,2020-11-09 18:32:45

Lorelei Pang,Update: They got rid of the full-screen ads. It really does have a nice UI -- I ended up reinstalling it after trying a handful more calendar apps. As long as the full-screen ads don't come back I'm happy with it. --- There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro.

I started with the free version and then upgraded to get more features because I love it. The task bar on the side is a life-saver for me and all my to-do's.

It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.",1,2019-07-03 12:19:29

This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version.

Stephanie Cervi,"This is hands down the best personal planning app I've ever come across. That being said, it's basically unusable on Android. The view jumps to the top of the day's task list at random, making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task.

Alex Ianta,"I like how it allows me to set any number of reminders, minutes/hours/days/weeks in advance either by push notification or email. But many little bugs pepper this app. The calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time. The location field tries to be smart by giving you a 'maps like' autocomplete, but this is annoying when you just want 'gym'. For some reason the first letter of an event name isn't registered by autocorrect, so 'Event' turns to 'venting'.",3,2019-07-18 13:53:31
Parshva Shah,"There's a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view, even in high end phones.

Jennita Wagner,"I would give this app 5 stars but I am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open. I pay the subscription for premium, and I love all the options in the app. But it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open, unless there is a notification in my notification bar that I can open the app with. This would be annoying even with a free app, but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous.

It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times.

Robert Rossana,I am running this app on a Droid Turbo with stock  Lollipop installed.  The app has a very nice layout but unfortunately I find it to be very buggy.

Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-)",4,2017-07-30 20:45:52
Ian Schoenrock,A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though,4,2017-10-10 01:34:51

I usually have to close it completely and reopen it to get dark mode to stick around. Other than that, though, this is a fantastic app.",4,2021-01-12 18:11:26

But i do love this app so much that I upgraded,4,2020-10-06 13:42:21
Allie Cruce,Excellent Application! Would've given 5 stars if the following want such a pain. Would like for it to be easier to remove a recurring event however. That seems to be an incredible pain.

Bob Thompson,"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",5,2019-03-27 01:47:14
