0,Doddy Wahyuwono,"Hi dev and product team, please remove the animation when ordering food. It doesn't support any functionality. Rather, directly displaying the old, real-time map view is more useful because I can ensure that the location is correct and it lets me know the driver's location. Please, don't be all style no substance.",2,12/15/2023 16:12
1,Elda Mahaindra,"Hi, developer, could you please remove the animations for preparing and packing food and instead display the map? Confirming my location, whether I've pinpointed it correctly or not, becomes more challenging because the app doesn't show the map. I often use saved locations, but the location shifts, and I can't confirm it until the driver leaves the restaurant.",5,10/22/2023 5:51
2,frecklixx_,"It is too slow to open and process the app. I face some errors too. Recently, I wanted to use Gojek this morning, but after waiting for a while, I still couldn't open the status detail. It turned out there was no order from the driver's app. So I updated the app, clicked the 'order' button again, but it was the same. Please fix the errors and bugs. [Edited] I read a review that the new update is kinda heavy, I agree with them. With more features, the updated app would be more heavy to use.",2,9/12/2023 2:24
3,Yohana Sitanggang,"It crashed a lot. I ended up causing a driver waiting for me for a long time outside my door, but the application was crashing, showing the cooking food display (in a frozen state. But my poo poo brain thought the restaurant still cooking). It crashed a lot for no reason as well. I've re-installed gojek, and it still happened. I wonder is it my device problem or not?",2,10/15/2023 14:08
4,リン赤沢,"I'm absolutely furious with this statement. ""No internet connection Internet not available please try again."" It's consistently like this, constantly having to reconnect to the internet. It's incredibly exasperating. Don't just concentrate on adding more features, address the connectivity problem as well. For instance, if there's a certain transaction that can't be completed, use a different notification, instead of one that makes no sense.",1,11/7/2023 10:06
5,Steven Kurniawan,Subscription auto renews without option to decline (when buying subscriptions). Doesn't say explicitly either that it auto renews. Prices are expensive if you don't have subscriptions. Has many additional charges. Aside from the standard ones. Not to mention they don't remind u with any kind of notifications when they renew your subscriptions. As if hoping that u forget about it.,1,11/14/2023 5:23
6,Nastashia Angelina,"There is a persistent bug that won't let me open the details of my order or cancel them. I can only open the chat with the driver without being able to see where the driver is, i can't also reach out to the driver.

7,Reynaert Pane,"Crashes all the time since the last 2 or 3 versions. Usually happens when confirming order or when the app is about to show the map.

Please fix this.",2,10/23/2023 14:34
8,LyPhi,"Worst update yet, App Freezes occasionally at that point there is nothing i can do other than force closing the app then relaunch it right after, also i can't even add any debit card anymore it just keeps on looping on the verification i entered everything correctly but it won't save anything thankfully they don't charge me for the failed transactions, anyway it works just fine in the previous versions.",1,10/9/2023 5:04
9,Adli Hadiyan Munif,"I'm honestly disappointed with these app cause the more years come, the more heavier it is. I've tried to downgraded to old version and it's lighter, but there's notification that reminds me to upgrade the apps to latest cause it's gonna be deactivated. I mean, the latest version is so slow and heavy. It need 1-2 minutes after opening till home screen, then 2-3 min to choose a service. Kinda disappointed because I've been using their service since 3-5 years ago, and it's not friendly anymore.",1,11/23/2020 15:13
10,Annas Rizki Kurnia,"To be honest, the whole is great, in general. But when you get into the chat feature to talk with the driver, the new feature of suggested messages is just one of the worst experiences. Too many accidental messages was sent and throws the usual habit of start typing right away. Really dissapointed beyond measure, but can only bear with it for now. Please do take into consideration the actual implementation of this feature for some people. Thank you, and I do apologize for the long message.",4,8/9/2020 8:46
11,Chiii,"It sucks. For a big company, they don't have person to verify data, so it's really hard to upgrade to gopay plus because it only uses machine. The reason when the upgrade's failed is not detailed too, doesn't tell which part of the point that make it's failed. The CS is not a help either, just says the same thing without solution. Also, the app always takes the farthest route or wrong route, unlike in google maps, and confuses both driver and customer.",1,1/23/2021 3:10
12,April L.,"Hi Gojek, great work so far. To me, the new UI has too much clutter. I've always preferred a simple, sleek, and practical UI. It also won't show me whether the app has successfully processed the tips for my drivers. The tip amount isn't even added to the receipt. I receive no notifications about it either. Rating/tip notifs keep popping up twice even under the conditions of a fully working internet source. I hope you guys will fix this soon.",3,6/6/2020 14:34
13,my Gembul,"1. So slow to load. 2. Drivers sometimes can't adjust total final prices (if items are not available or if I need to add more items after ordering), it's not as flexible as it was. Your flexibility was one of the reasons I used it more than Grab app. 3. Tipping drivers. NO longer shows the amount in the history. I have to calculate it to make sure the tips are already included. Very annoying because I often place several orders at one time! 4. Can't reorder,unless items/amounts are 100% the same",2,12/2/2020 4:23
14,Karel Bondan,"I definitely love gojek, but not that much love for the app. I prefer the old UI & UX tbh. Sure it looks more modern and such for the new update, but it's harder to navigate. And, the new update is kinda heavy(?) compared to the old one. It has slight lags although I have a quite good phone. Also, the one thing that's kinda annoying is everytime I open the app, it always says to turn on my location service although it's been turned on at the time I open the app. It's a small bug, but it sure is getting annoying overtime. A suggestion from me, simplify the UI & UX again, and don't make the app too heavy for phones to handle, I mean, not everyone is using a high-end spec phone. You don't want people's phone to be able to cook a food, right? I'd surely change the ratings if all of these gets fixed... hopefully...",3,9/10/2020 7:43
15,Fauzan Permana,"Dude please bring the old UI back, it's great and if you're trying to do a better one, tbh it's not working. I can't find stuffs. Also the app is sometimes sooooo heavy and buggy chomping on RAMs. Do a lighter one, like we can't really explore anything on the app when it's too inconvenience to maneuver you know. So your goal to improve the UX pretty much isn't working.",2,6/7/2020 4:07
16,Claus Siagian,"It's going down since ever. Less promotion or even if there is one, it is not really worth it. Kinda harder too to use since it is updating it's ui like every once in a while. Have to uninstalled it until it is better. And it's so complicated to delete your gojek account because it is not in the menu and you have to contact the customer service even just via email. Really need a major problem solving.",1,11/4/2020 14:52
17,A Google user,"This should be a good app. But it's getting more pricey, even when the location is very close to my address. Then it's very difficult to find a driver on the rainy day. I think they don't give a raincoat for their driver. And one more problem is they use GPS, but the location pick up seems always incorrect. Driver sometimes get lost when trying to pick me up at my house. Pls fix it. 😕😕",1,2/16/2020 3:19
18,Prayoga Limantara,"Good service. Decent app. Seriously, how hard it is for Gojek to add some saved/favorite places feature on its app? It will save time for the costumer & the driver as well. The GPS service in Indonesia is not that good, so pinpoint a location on the map is not effective. Not all people could point their exact current location on a 2D map in an area with poor GPS service. Plus, the address description generates by the map will mostly be different than the actual address. It's so confusing!",3,11/17/2020 1:46
19,ilham adi gunawan,"Before adding so much content and feature on your app, please fix the lagging and crashing issues. I've been using this app for a long while and i install and uninstall it for several time because of lag, black screen, and crash. It doesn't help when the new update came and so much content being added but the optimization is terrible. Also graphic design is nice but too much of it feel cluttered and a sore in the eye. But this one probably just my taste. Please fix it, thanks.",1,12/13/2021 14:54
20,Cheesy Andawsome,"I hate to say this, but since the app was updated with new UI/UX (am I right?), it lagging soooo much! I thought the caused by my phone or memory internal or something else. Then, I realized that everyone's complaining too on social media. Please, bring it back to the 2018's design. The newest just made me stressful! 😡😭 I want a simple yet stylish design app for transport online, not a complicated app!",1,3/10/2021 15:28
21,Danny Dhaneswara,"1. The App is getting slower and slower. Been a while and thought the dev team would solve it soon, but man was I wrong. 2. The drivers' location won't even bothered to be updated after I: re-open the app, change my networks, refresh everything that I could've think of. It's been months now and I'm genuinely surprised that there's no change whatsoever. Might as well remove the drivers' location feature for good 3.

After that, I go back to my checkout screen and suddenly the food was just ordered. Even I didnt have a chance to change the payment method! Such a dissapointed app! The new UI is not great as before. It looks more beautiful but for UX is terrible! Even when I wanted to cancel the order, the CS was always busy!",1,1/25/2021 14:57
23,Hanif Firdaus,"The latest ui is confusing. I can't find current orders, notifications, etc. I also find difficult to choose gopay paylater. I have to scroll down the gopay menu to see the paylater menu, and it's soooo small. And i dont get the point why you add the illustrations when scroll down the home, it's unnecessary. Upgrading doesnt mean you have to put a lot of illustrations into it. I had a horrible experience using this version, lagging everywhere. Please bring back the old ui.",2,3/9/2021 6:38
24,R. A. Kayika Dewipraja,"Really appreciate this app design and it's simple. Helps a lot. Maybe just some bugs I've experienced, I accidentally (?) ordered 3x food in the same restaurant but with 3 different drivers. I assumed it happened because of the automatic driver search feature?

Additionally, repeated experience with not getting a driver but the order has been sent, so it was processed for hours. Drivers did not respond, FAQ page was not helpful. Very frustrating experience. Gojek isnt as great as i remembered it. PS: The app has been very slow to open. Another thing to consider if you are in a hurry.",1,1/4/2021 14:03

But suddenly my account was locked do to false detection of multiple account logins from my one device (which never happened, I never even log out from my account let alone log in with other accounts). Sadly the only solution from Gojek is to log in from different device (which I dont have) and no intention at all in investigating further their false detection!",2,7/8/2022 9:14
29,Fikri Hasnul,"The current policy is strange & burdensome for customers. For transfers, you have to upgrade ur gopay, I think it should be part of the basic features of gopay without the need to upgrade. You can make an alt policy, e.g if the transfers exceeds the max then upgrade to gopay plus. It's fine if the upgrade goes smoothly, but when the files are a little blurry, ur upgrade will fail. There are also some additional fees, including application service fees, etc. You still have gps & slowness prblm.",1,9/30/2021 11:57
30,Muhamad Haykal,"The latest version is actually not so bad, it's a lot better now than the first time Gojek change the overall look of the app. However, I found one quite annoying thing on the restaurant page of Gofood while you're using the search feature. The search column will automatically disappear when you delete what you type so you have to tap the Binocular icon again every single time you want to change your search. Small thing indeed but quite annoying, really. It's not the case of search feature on any other page of Gojek App. Hopefully, this little thing here will be fixed in the next update.",3,7/15/2021 6:06
31,Raine Alvin,"I use the service a lot, as was normal for a college girl who find it such a bother to go out and buy things for herself would. But the 'complaint' options are, in my opinion, too restricted. I've been meaning to raise a problem in regard to a specific route (which was the map problem), but there's only option for GPS accuracy. It isn't a big deal, but would surely save the driver some extra minutes of confusement.",5,3/1/2022 5:02
32,Adrian Natawidjaja,"Dumb algorithm, especially for cars. The algo will pick a driver that is close to you, but didn't consider the route the driver has to take to reach you. So, often you will get a driver that already passed your pickup point, forcing the driver to take a longer route turning back to reach the pickup point. This gives poor experience for both the driver and the rider (having to wait longer than needed).",2,10/3/2021 4:14
33,Mercoledi Nasiir,"Recently, the home app doesn't load properly, with only a picture of a robot and a couple saying ""let's try again"" show up instead of the usual interface. And every time I try tipping the drivers, there's an unclosable popup telling ""your device is offline"" even though I'm definitely online. Tried switching my network on either wifi or data connection but result is the same. Also the popup keeps reappearing after I close it. I'm not sure if my tip got sent through.",2,7/19/2021 1:51

35,Fruitty Pun,"The app is excellent and complete, the service is quick most of the time. But, I hope they can fix the address/location bug. I always set delivery location to my home when ordering gofood, so I don't really pay attention to delivery address when I order food, but sometimes the delivery address change randomly and I didn't notice, so it create inconvenience to me and the driver when I clarify the actual address.

36,Ruth Taridayana,"I am always happy using this app despite its slow-loading map. It really eases my life to get the food, low-cost transportation, make payments, pay bills, and even ask someone else to buy me things from stores when I am sick.

I just wish they have an extra checkbox for [no plastic utensils] so I don't have to paste in the food note every single time.

509,Rosewin Pascua,It was good before but even just install on another phone it has this problem that when you book the booking from the phone and the driver and the driver are not the same and have to pay for it and drop you on the destination that the driver has and doesn't allow from the app to edit the destination!😥😡 so have to get off from the taxi in a random location of destination which the driver's destination 😡,1,7/4/2022 2:05

Gofood plus use to give discount to all delivery but now it's only give discount on selected merchant. Whats the point to level up my tier to sultan then if you gonna charge me more for the delivery fee? Such a greedy company. I rather move to Grab and they consistent promotion.",1,3/10/2023 3:42

For the gofood is also the same... The price for offline is less than in online... I think because the seller must pay app service so they increase the price if using gofood.

I can get to the same place with a distance of 1KM using another transportation method at a lower cost. The cheaper the transportation costs, the more I can save on travel costs. The last thing I want to say is, the number masking technology in this application often creates contacts that have no details and the name only has a profile picture with the Gojek logo and there is even a box that has no details, the name and profile picture at all, so I can say This application often creates junk contacts which I routinely delete at once so that my contacts are clean of contacts that have no names, details and no profile picture.",3,3/28/2022 8:27

However around 2.30pm the driver was still some distance away and he cancelled. The app started finding for a new driver. But just nice at 2.37 it stopped searching and said no driver to be found.

The driver didn't inform about this till later on. I was unable to change my order to something else so I could still use the voucher. It might be something simple maybe. But it doesn't change the fact that I am disappointed about this. And it was my first time using gojek again after a long time. What a let down...",3,6/6/2020 7:19
584,A Sagtavilia,I feel so annoyed with the option to pay automatically change to cash and not gopay even after topping up. I was used to paying via gopay but the design is too subtle to tell me it was paying with cash and not gopay. It'd be okay if we have option to change from cash to gopay after ordering but we cannot and some orders cannot be cancelled. It's inconvenient especially in pandemic where we have to limit meeting. The drivers also tend to cancel on cash payment orders which makes orders longer.,2,5/22/2021 4:25

726,yudi ifa,At least there are 2 checkpoints in the app where customer can give tip to the driver. I've seen this for quiet long and it's fine.

Until it improves, I'm deleting it for good. Had rec'd a few $4 e-vouchers. But the net fare after the e-voucher were the same as grab, sometimes even more expensive than comfort delgro. This means that the discount vouchers are just cheap bait to lure ridership. Such scam business model that Gojek use. No wonder the company is doing poorly.",1,12/10/2020 13:19

After years of spending money in this app, I eventually became ""Anak Sultan"". Then, there are no discount or vouchers whatsoever.. None.

1032,Hammad Ahmad,I have been using them for last 4 years but now I am planning to get rid of them because it's a scam when it comes to promo on GoFood. For example they will show you 30% discount but in reyonly apply 10%. This started happening only a few weeks back and customer support does not care when you complain and even share screenshots. They will just close your ticket and say that we can only help you with ongoing orders.,1,9/7/2022 12:00
1033,Lefa Moffat,Mainly use it to get food or order rides and it always works great. Only thing that's missing is the ability to tip the drivers via the app. Grab has it and it's the only reason why I would consider switching,5,8/23/2022 12:08

The funny thing is, after I contacted chatbot for solution, the only solution they provide is to look for a new driver.. who also happened to be unresponsive (I've already tried contacting them via chat/call). Cancellation should be made possible in events like these.",1,4/16/2023 13:57

2227,Ksh MLim,Time estimated for car to arrive is horrible never close to thr said time as compare to other platform. You got to add on 7 to 10min on top the estmated time given. Eg. Stated car arriving in 8min have to add on to 15 or 18mins. Advantage is just sometime charges is cheaper then other platform. Never use Go Jek if you are in rush of time. If you are not in the rush can wait want to save money you may try GoJek,1,1/11/2022 0:09

In preparation for a trip to Indonesia, I downloaded this ride share app and activated it without issue. (But it turns for the worst.) Then I downloaded a DIFFERENT ride share app for Indonesia called MyBluebird. This app hanged and never sent me an activation code. So, I tried several times. Fail. THEN this app, Gojek, sent me a notification stating that my account is suspended because too many activation code sent (from a different app!). The customer service was hard to figure it out, but I did. I sent an appeal stating what happened. A week later, Gojek denied my appeal and blocked my email from future communications. HORRIBLE! So, we can conclude that at best Gojek and MyBluebird share a confirmation code process. Is this legal? Is this because of sloppy code developers or an outsourced agency that convoluted the process? Or is something really evil going on where Gojek and MyBluebird share/steal data from your phone? I would encourage Google to review these two apps and suspend them until they fix it and correct victims such as myself. This is truly a horrible app with horrible customer service.

Gojek alws says that the driver is dropping off a prev customer and it will arrive in estimated about 6mins but it arrives 15mins later. If its going to be long then just write it there. Also when the driver is going to be late the estimated time either increases or just keep stopping at that 2mins but it takes 5-6.
